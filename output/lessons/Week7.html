<p><span><strong>Theorem</strong></span>: Every positive integer is a
sum of (one or more) distinct powers of <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. <span><em>Binary expansions
exist!</em></span></p>
<p>Recall the definition for binary expansion:</p>
<p><span><strong>Definition</strong></span> For <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> a positive integer, the
<span><strong>binary expansion of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span></strong></span> is <span
class="math display">\[(a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0)_b\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is a positive integer, <span
class="math inline">\(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{k-1}\)</span> are each <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a_{k-1}
\neq  0\)</span>, and <span class="math display">\[n =  \sum_{i=0}^{k-1}
a_{i} b^{i}\]</span></p>
<p>The idea in the “Least significant first" algorithm for computing
binary expansions is that the binary expansion of
<span><em>half</em></span> a number becomes <span><em>part</em></span>
of the binary expansion of the number of itself. We can use this idea in
a proof by strong induction that binary expansions exist for all
positive integers <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p><span><strong>Proof by strong induction</strong></span>, with <span
class="math inline">\(b=1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(j=0\)</span>.</p>
<p><span><strong>Basis step</strong></span>: WTS property is true about
<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p><span><strong>Recursive step</strong></span>: Consider an arbitrary
integer <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Assume (as the strong induction hypothesis, IH) that the property is
true about each of <span class="math inline">\(1, \ldots,
n\)</span>.</p>
<p>WTS that the property is true about <span
class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span>.</p>
<p><span><em>Idea</em></span>: We will apply the IH to <span
class="math inline">\((n+1) \textbf{ div } 2\)</span>.</p>
<p><span><em>Why is this ok?</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>Why is this helpful?</em></span></p>
<p>By the IH, we can write <span class="math inline">\((n+1) \textbf{
div } 2\)</span> as a sum of powers of <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. In other words, there are values <span
class="math inline">\(a_{k-1}, \ldots, a_0\)</span> such that each <span
class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a_{k-1} =
1\)</span>, and <span class="math display">\[\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a_i 2^i =
(n+1) \textbf{ div } 2\]</span> Define the collection of coefficients
<span class="math display">\[c_{j} =
   \begin{cases}
        a_{j-1} \qquad&amp;\text{if $1 \leq j \leq k$}\\
        (n+1) \textbf{ mod } 2 &amp;\text{if $j = 0$}
   \end{cases}\]</span> Calculating: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
{2}
    \sum_{j=0}^k c_j 2^j &amp;= c_0 + \sum_{j=1}^k c_j 2^j
    = c_0 + \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} c_{i+1} 2^{i+1} &amp;\qquad
&amp;\text{re-indexing the summation}\\
    &amp;= c_0 + 2 \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} c_{i+1}2^i &amp;\qquad
&amp;\text{factoring out a $2$ from each term in the sum}\\
    &amp;= c_0 + 2 \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a_{i} 2^i &amp;\qquad
&amp;\text{by definition of $c_{i+1}$}\\
    &amp;= c_0 + 2 \left(~(n+1) \textbf{ div } 2 ~\right) &amp;\qquad
&amp;\text{by IH} \\
    &amp;= \left(~ (n+1) \textbf{ mod } 2 ~\right ) + 2 \left(~(n+1)
\textbf{ div } 2 ~\right) &amp;\qquad &amp;\text{by definition of $c_0$}
\\
    &amp;= n+1 &amp;\qquad&amp;\text{by definition of long division}
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> can be expressed as a
sum of powers of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, as
required.</p>

id="representing-positive-integers-with-primes">Representing positive
integers with primes</h3>
<p><span><strong>Theorem</strong></span>: Every positive integer
<span><em>greater than 1</em></span> is a product of (one or more)
primes.</p>
<p><span><strong>Before we prove, let’s try some
examples</strong></span>:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(20 =\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(100 =\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(5 =\)</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Proof by strong induction</strong></span>, with <span
class="math inline">\(b=2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(j=0\)</span>.</p>
<p><span><strong>Basis step</strong></span>: WTS property is true about
<span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> is itself prime, it is
already written as a product of (one) prime.</p>
<p><span><strong>Recursive step</strong></span>: Consider an arbitrary
integer <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 2\)</span>. Assume (as the
strong induction hypothesis, IH) that the property is true about each of
<span class="math inline">\(2, \ldots, n\)</span>. WTS that the property
is true about <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span>: We want to show
that <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> can be written as a
product of primes. Notice that <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span>
is itself prime or it is composite.</p>
<p><span><em>Case 1</em></span>: assume <span
class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> is prime and then immediately it is
written as a product of (one) prime so we are done.</p>
<p><span><em>Case 2</em></span>: assume that <span
class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> is composite so there are integers
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(n+1 =
xy\)</span> and each of them is between <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> (inclusive). Therefore, the induction
hypothesis applies to each of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> so each of these factors of <span
class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> can be written as a product of
primes. Multiplying these products together, we get a product of primes
that gives <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span>, as required.</p>
<p>Since both cases give the necessary conclusion, the proof by cases
for the recursive step is complete.</p>

id="sending-old-fashioned-mail-with-postage-stamps">Sending
old-fashioned mail with postage stamps</h3>
<p>Suppose we had postage stamps worth <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span> cents and <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span> cents. Which number of cents can we
form using these stamps? In other words, which postage can we pay?</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(11\)</span>?</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(15\)</span>?</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>?</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    &amp;CanPay(0) \land \lnot CanPay(1) \land \lnot CanPay(2) \land \\
    &amp;CanPay(3) \land \lnot CanPay(4) \land CanPay(5) \land CanPay(6)
\\
    &amp;\lnot CanPay(7) \land \forall n \in \mathbb{Z}^{\geq 8}
CanPay(n)
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>where the predicate <span class="math inline">\(CanPay\)</span> with
domain <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> is <span
class="math display">\[CanPay(n) = \exists x \in \mathbb{N} \exists y
\in \mathbb{N}  ( 5x+3y = n)\]</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Proof</strong></span> (idea): First, explicitly give
witnesses or general arguments for postages between <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(7\)</span>. To prove the universal claim, we can
use mathematical induction or strong induction.</p>
<p><span><em>Approach 1, mathematical induction</em></span>: if we have
stamps that add up to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> cents, need
to use them (and others) to give <span
class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> cents. How do we get <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> cent with just <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-cent and <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span>-cent stamps?</p>
<p>Either <u>take away a <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>-cent
stamps and add two <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-cent
stamps</u>,</p>
<p>or <u>take away three <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-cent
stamps and add two <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>-cent
stamps</u>.</p>
<p>The details of this proof by mathematical induction are making sure
we have enough stamps to use one of these approaches.</p>
<p><span><em>Approach 2, strong induction</em></span>: assuming we know
how to make postage for <span><strong>all</strong></span> smaller values
(greater than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span>), when
we need to make <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> cents, <u>add
one <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> cent stamp to however we make
<span class="math inline">\((n+1) - 3\)</span> cents</u>.</p>
<p>The details of this proof by strong induction are making sure we stay
in the domain of the universal when applying the induction
hypothesis.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="finding-a-winning-strategy-for-a-game">Finding a winning strategy
for a game</h3>
<p>Consider the following game: two players start with two (equal) piles
of jellybeans in front of them. They take turns removing any positive
integer number of jellybeans at a time from one of two piles in front of
them in turns.</p>
<p>The player who removes the last jellybean wins the game.</p>
<p>Which player (if any) has a strategy to guarantee to win the
game?</p>
<p>Try out some games, starting with <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> jellybean in each pile, then <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> jellybeans in each pile, then <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span> jellybeans in each pile. Who wins in
each game?</p>
<p>Notice that reasoning about the strategy for the <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> jellybean game is easier than about the
strategy for the <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> jellybean
game.</p>
<p><span><em>Formulate a winning strategy by working to transform the
game to a simpler one we know we can win.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>Player 2’s Strategy</em></span>: Take the same number of
jellybeans that Player 1 did, but from the opposite pile.</p>
<p><span><em>Why is this a good idea</em></span>: If Player 2 plays this
strategy, at the next turn Player 1 faces a game with the same setup as
the original, just with fewer jellybeans in the two piles. Then Player 2
can keep playing this strategy to win.</p>
<p><span><strong>Claim</strong></span>: Player 2’s strategy guarantees
they will win the game.</p>
<p><span><strong>Proof</strong></span>: By strong induction, we will
prove that for all positive integers <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, Player 2’s strategy guarantees a win
in the game that starts with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
jellybeans in each pile.</p>
<p><span><strong>Basis step</strong></span>: WTS Player 2’s strategy
guarantees a win when each pile starts with <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> jellybean.</p>
<p>In this case, Player 1 has to take the jellybean from one of the
piles (because they can’t take from both piles at once). Following the
strategy, Player 2 takes the jellybean from the other pile, and wins
because this is the last jellybean.</p>
<p><span><strong>Recursive step</strong></span>: Let <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive integer. As the strong
induction hypothesis, assume that Player 2’s strategy guarantees a win
in the games where there are <span class="math inline">\(1, 2, \ldots,
n\)</span> many jellybeans in each pile at the start of the game.</p>
<p>WTS that Player 2’s strategy guarantees a win in the game where there
are <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> in the jellybeans in each
pile at the start of the game.</p>
<p>In this game, the first move has Player 1 take some number, call it
<span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> (where <span
class="math inline">\(1 \leq c \leq n+1\)</span>), of jellybeans from
one of the piles. Playing according to their strategy, Player 2 then
takes the same number of jellybeans from the other pile.</p>
<p>Notice that <span class="math inline">\((c = n+1) \lor (c \leq
n)\)</span>.</p>
<p><span><em>Case 1</em></span>: Assume <span class="math inline">\(c =
n+1\)</span>, then in their first move, Player 2 wins because they take
all of the second pile, which includes the last jellybean.</p>
<p><span><em>Case 2</em></span>: Assume <span class="math inline">\(c
\leq n\)</span>. Then after Player 2’s first move, the two piles have an
equal number of jellybeans. The number of jellybeans in each pile is
<span class="math display">\[(n+1) - c\]</span> and, since <span
class="math inline">\(1 \leq c \leq n\)</span>, this number is between
<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Thus, at this stage of the game, the
game appears identical to a new game where the two piles have an equal
number of jellybeans between <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Thus, the strong induction
hypothesis applies, and Player 2’s strategy guarantees they win.</p>

this means, <span class="math inline">\(x \leq 1\)</span>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="sets-of-numbers">Sets of numbers</h2>
<p>We’ve seen multiple representations of the set of positive integers
(using base expansions and using prime factorization). Now we’re going
to expand our attention to other sets of numbers as well.</p>
<p>The <span><strong>set of rational numbers</strong></span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span> is defined as <span
class="math display">\[\left\{ \frac{p}{q} \mid p \in \mathbb{Z}  \text{
and  } q  \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ and } q \neq  0 \right\}
\text{~~~~or, equivalently,~~~~}
\{ x  \in  \mathbb{R} \mid \exists p \in \mathbb{Z}  \exists q \in
\mathbb{Z}^+ ( p =  x \cdot q) \}\]</span></p>
<p><span><em>Extra practice</em></span>: Use the definition of set
equality to prove that the definitions above give the same set.</p>
<p>We have the following subset relationships between sets of
numbers:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathbb{Z}^{+} \subsetneq \mathbb{N}
\subsetneq \mathbb{Z} \subsetneq \mathbb{Q} \subsetneq
\mathbb{R}\]</span></p>
<p>Which of the proper subset inclusions above can you prove?</p>
<p><span><strong>Goal</strong></span>: The square root of <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> is not a rational number. In other
words: <span class="math inline">\(\neg \exists x \in \mathbb{Q} ( x^2
-  2 = 0)\)</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Attempted proof</strong></span>: The definition of the
set of rational numbers is the collection of fractions <span
class="math inline">\(p/q\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is an integer and <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is a nonzero integer. Looking for a
<span><strong>witness</strong></span> <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, we can write the square root of <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> as the fraction <span
class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2 }/1\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is a nonzero integer. Since the
numerator is not in the domain, this witness is not allowed, and we have
shown that the square root of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> is
not a fraction of integers (with nonzero denominator). Thus, the square
root of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> is not rational.</p>
<p><span><em>The problem in the above attempted proof is
that</em></span> <u></u></p>
<p><span><strong>Lemma 1:</strong></span> For every two integers <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, not both zero, with <span
class="math inline">\(gcd(~(a,b)~) = 1\)</span>, it is not the case that
both <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is even and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is even.</p>
<p><span><strong>Lemma 2:</strong></span> For every integer <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
is even if and only if <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span> is
even.</p>
<p><span><strong>Proof</strong></span>: Towards a proof by
contradiction, we will define a statement <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2} \in \mathbb{Q} \to (r \land \lnot
r)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Assume that <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2} \in
\mathbb{Q}\)</span>. Namely, there are positive integers <span
class="math inline">\(p, q\)</span> such that <span
class="math display">\[\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}\]</span> Let <span
class="math inline">\(a= \frac{p}{gcd( ~(p,q)~)}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b = \frac{q}{gcd(~(p,q)~)}\)</span>, then <span
class="math display">\[\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b} \qquad \text{and} \qquad
gcd(~(a,b)~) = 1\]</span></p>
<p>By Lemma 1, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are not both even. We define <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> to be the statement “<span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is even and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is even”, and we have proved <span
class="math inline">\(\lnot r\)</span>.</p>
<p>Squaring both sides and clearing denominator: <span
class="math inline">\(2b^2 = a^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>By definition of even, since <span class="math inline">\(b^2\)</span>
is an integer<span class="math inline">\(, a^2\)</span> is even.</p>
<p>By Lemma 2, this guarantees that <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is even too. So, by definition of even,
there is some integer (call it <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>),
such that <span class="math inline">\(a = 2c\)</span>.</p>
<p>Plugging into the equation: <span class="math display">\[2b^2 = a^2 =
(2c)^2 = 4c^2\]</span> and dividing both sides by <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> <span class="math display">\[b^2 =
2c^2\]</span> and since <span class="math inline">\(c^2\)</span> is an
integer, <span class="math inline">\(b^2\)</span> is even. By Lemma 2,
<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is even too. Thus, <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is even and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is even and we have proved <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>.</p>
<p>In other words, assuming that <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}
\in \mathbb{Q}\)</span> guarantees <span class="math inline">\(r \land
\lnot r\)</span>, which is impossible, so <span
class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2} \notin \mathbb{Q}\)</span>. QED</p>

<p>In this question, we’ll consider two possible proofs of the statement
<span class="math display">\[\forall n  \in  \mathbb{Z}^{\geq
8}  \exists x \in \mathbb{N}  \exists y \in \mathbb{N}  (  5x+3y
=  n)\]</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>First approach, using mathematical induction (<span
class="math inline">\(b=8\)</span>).</p>
<p><span><strong>Basis step</strong></span>: WTS property is true about
<span class="math inline">\(8\)</span>. Consider the witnesses <span
class="math inline">\(x = 1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y=1\)</span>. These are nonnegative integers and
<span class="math inline">\(5 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 1 = 8\)</span>, as
required.</p>
<p><span><strong>Recursive step</strong></span>: Consider an arbitrary
<span class="math inline">\(n \geq 8\)</span>. Assume (as the induction
hypothesis, IH) that there are nonnegative integers <span
class="math inline">\(x, y\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(n =  5x +  3y\)</span>. WTS that there are
nonnegative integers <span class="math inline">\(x&#39;, y&#39;\)</span>
such that <span class="math inline">\(n+1 = 5x&#39; +  3y&#39;\)</span>.
We consider two cases, depending on whether any <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span> cent stamps are used for <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p><span><em>Case 1</em></span>: Assume <span class="math inline">\(x
\geq  1\)</span> (we assume that at least one <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span> cent stamp is used for <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>). Define <span
class="math inline">\(x&#39; = x-1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y&#39;=y+2\)</span> (both in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> by case assumption).</p>
<p>Calculating: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
5x&#39; +  3y&#39; &amp;\overset{\text{by def}}{=}  5(x-1) +  3(y+2)  =
5x -  5 +3y +   6  \\
&amp;\overset{\text{rearranging}} = (5x+3y) -5  + 6\\
&amp; \overset{\text{IH}}{=} n-5+6 =  n+1
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p><span><em>Case 2</em></span>: Assume <span class="math inline">\(x =
0\)</span>. Therefore <span class="math inline">\(n  = 3y\)</span>, so
since <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 8\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y \geq 3\)</span>. Define <span
class="math inline">\(x&#39; = 2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y&#39;=y-3\)</span> (both in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> by case assumption).
Calculating: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
5x&#39; +  3y&#39; &amp;\overset{\text{by def}}{=}  5(2) +  3(y-3)  =
10  +3y -9  \\
&amp;\overset{\text{rearranging}} = 3y +10 -9 \\
&amp;\overset{\text{IH and case}}{=} n+10-9 =  n+1
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Since the goal has been proved from each case, the proof by cases is
complete and we have proved the recursive step. <span
class="math inline">\(\square\)</span><br />
Why was the recursive step split into two cases?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Because there are two variables <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> that need witnesses.</p></li>
<li><p>Because the statement has alternating quantifiers <span
class="math inline">\(\forall\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\exists\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Because the witness values need to be nonnegative and subtraction
may lead to negative values.</p></li>
<li><p>Because the domain is all integers greater than or equal to <span
class="math inline">\(8\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Because there are two steps in the recursive definition of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span></p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Second approach, by strong induction (<span
class="math inline">\(b=8\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(j=2\)</span>)</p>
<p><span><strong>Basis step</strong></span>: WTS property is true about
<span class="math inline">\(8, 9, 10\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Consider the witnesses <span class="math inline">\(x =
1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y=1\)</span>. These are
nonnegative integers and <span class="math inline">\(5 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot
1 = 8\)</span>, as required.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the witnesses <span class="math inline">\(x =
0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y=3\)</span>. These are
nonnegative integers and <span class="math inline">\(5 \cdot 0 + 3 \cdot
3 = 9\)</span>, as required.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the witnesses <span class="math inline">\(x =
2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y=0\)</span>. These are
nonnegative integers and <span class="math inline">\(5 \cdot 2 + 3 \cdot
0 = 10\)</span>, as required.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Recursive step</strong></span>: Consider an arbitrary
<span class="math inline">\(n \geq 10\)</span>. Assume, as the strong
induction hypothesis, that the property is true about each of <span
class="math inline">\(8, 9, 10, \ldots, n\)</span>. WTS that there are
nonnegative integers <span class="math inline">\(x&#39;, y&#39;\)</span>
such that <span class="math inline">\(n+1 = 5x&#39;

<p>Since <u>Blank 1</u>, by the strong induction hypothesis, there are
nonnegative integers <span class="math inline">\(x, y\)</span> such that

<li><p>Why did we use strong induction to prove that Player 2’s strategy
guarantees a win?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Because there are two players in the game.</p></li>
<li><p>Because each turn can involve a player taking some positive
number of jellybeans from a pile, not just one jellybean.</p></li>
<li><p>Because the strategy player 2 uses depends on what player 1
does.</p></li>
<li><p>Because the set of natural numbers is recursively
defined.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>If we modify the game so that in each turn, a player could take
jellybeans from one or both piles, which player has a winning
strategy?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Player 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Player 2.</p></li>
<li><p>Neither in general, the existence of a winning strategy for the
players depends on how many jellybeans are in each pile to
start.</p></li>

exactly one jellybean, which player has a winning strategy?</p>

<p>Consider this (incomplete) definition:</p>

<p>We will prove that there is no greatest prime number</p>
<p><span><strong>Proof</strong></span> Assume, towards a <u>BLANK1</u>,
that there is a greatest prime number, call it <span
class="math inline">\(n_{BIG}\)</span>. In particular, this means that
there are finitely many primes. Let’s label them in order <span
class="math inline">\(p_1, \ldots, p_n\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(p_1 = 2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(p_n = n_{BIG}\)</span>. Choose <span
class="math inline">\(r =\)</span> <u>BLANK2</u>. We proved in class
that <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is
<span><strong>true</strong></span>. It remains to show that (under our
assumption) <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is
<span><strong>false</strong></span>, because that would complete the
contradiction argument. Define the integer <span
class="math display">\[C = (p_1 \cdots p_n) + 1\]</span> This is a
positive integer greater than <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.
However, we will show that it does not have any prime factors and thus
is not a product of primes. By our assumption, the only prime numbers
are <span class="math inline">\(p_1, \ldots,
p_n\)</span>. Thus, to show that <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>
does not have any prime factors means to show that <span
class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span> is not a factor of <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> for each value of <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> from <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Towards a universal generalization,
let <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> be an arbitrary between <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> (inclusive). We need to prove that
<span class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span> is not a factor of <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. By definition of <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[C = p_i (
p_1 \cdots p_{i-1} p_{i+1} \cdots p_n) + 1\]</span> so <span
class="math inline">\(C \textbf{ div } p_i = p_1 \cdots p_{i-1} p_{i+1}
\cdots p_n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C \textbf{ mod } p_i
= 1\)</span> (because <span class="math inline">\(p_i &gt; 1\)</span>
since it is prime). Since <span class="math inline">\(C \textbf{ mod }
p_i \neq 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span> is not a
factor of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. Thus <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> witnesses that the universal claim is
false, and we have proved that <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is
false.</p>

<p>We will consider two ways for calculating the gcd. In each part of
the question, you’ll calculate <span class="math inline">\(gcd(~(306,
120)~\)</span>).</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The first approach uses some of the claims we proved in class to
get the following algorithm:</p>
<div class="algorithm">
<p>procedure <span
class="math inline">\(\textit{Euclidean}\)</span>(<span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>: a positive integer, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>: a positive integer) <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> := <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>
:= <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> while <span
class="math inline">\(y \neq 0\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> := <span class="math inline">\(x
\textbf{ mod } y\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> :=
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> := <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> return <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\{
\textrm{the result of } gcd(~(a,b)~)\}\)</span></p>
</div>
<p>Tracing this algorithm, lines 2 and 3 initialize the variables <span
class="math display">\[x:= 306 \qquad y:=120\]</span> Entering the while
loop, the variable <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is initialized
to <span class="math display">\[r:= 66\]</span> because <span
class="math inline">\(306 = 2 \cdot 120 + 66\)</span> so <span
class="math inline">\(306 \textbf{ mod } 120 = 66\)</span>. Calculate
and fill in the updated value of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>
in each subsequent iteration of the <span><strong>while</strong></span>
loop, and then give the value of <span class="math inline">\(gcd(~(306,
120)~\)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p>The second approach uses the representation of positive integers
greater than <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> as products of
primes. To calculate <span class="math inline">\(gcd(~(a,b)~)\)</span>
we find the prime factorizations of each of <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and then calculate the number that
results from multiplying together terms <span
class="math inline">\(p^c\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is a prime that appears in
<span><em>both</em></span> prime factorizations of <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is the <span><em>minimum</em></span>
number of times <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> appears in the
two factorizations.</p>
<p>Select the prime factorizations for <span
class="math inline">\(306\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(120\)</span> and express their <span
class="math inline">\(gcd\)</span> as a product of powers of primes.</p>
<p>Possible factorizations:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(306 = 2 \cdot 153\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(120 = 2 \cdot 60\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(306 = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot
17\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(120 = 1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot
8\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(306 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot
17\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(120 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3
\cdot 5\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Possible <span class="math inline">\(gcd\)</span> choices:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(2\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(2 \cdot 3\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(5 \cdot 17\)</span></p></li>
