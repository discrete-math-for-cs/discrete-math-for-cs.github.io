<p>Suppose we had postage stamps worth <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span> cents and <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span> cents. Which number of cents can we
form using these stamps? In other words, which postage can we pay?</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(11\)</span>?</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(15\)</span>?</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>?</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    &amp;CanPay(0) \land \lnot CanPay(1) \land \lnot CanPay(2) \land \\
    &amp;CanPay(3) \land \lnot CanPay(4) \land CanPay(5) \land CanPay(6)
\\
    &amp;\lnot CanPay(7) \land \forall n \in \mathbb{Z}^{\geq 8}
CanPay(n)
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>where the predicate <span class="math inline">\(CanPay\)</span> with
domain <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> is <span
class="math display">\[CanPay(n) = \exists x \in \mathbb{N} \exists y
\in \mathbb{N}  ( 5x+3y = n)\]</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Proof</strong></span> (idea): First, explicitly give
witnesses or general arguments for postages between <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(7\)</span>. To prove the universal claim, we can
use mathematical induction or strong induction.</p>
<p><span><em>Approach 1, mathematical induction</em></span>: if we have
stamps that add up to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> cents, need
to use them (and others) to give <span
class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> cents. How do we get <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> cent with just <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-cent and <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span>-cent stamps?</p>
<p>Either <u>take away a <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>-cent
stamps and add two <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-cent
stamps</u>,</p>
<p>or <u>take away three <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-cent
stamps and add two <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>-cent
stamps</u>.</p>
<p>The details of this proof by mathematical induction are making sure
we have enough stamps to use one of these approaches.</p>
<p><span><em>Approach 2, strong induction</em></span>: assuming we know
how to make postage for <span><strong>all</strong></span> smaller values
(greater than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span>), when
we need to make <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> cents, <u>add
one <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> cent stamp to however we make
<span class="math inline">\((n+1) - 3\)</span> cents</u>.</p>
<p>The details of this proof by strong induction are making sure we stay
in the domain of the universal when applying the induction
hypothesis.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="strong-induction-nim">Strong induction

<p>Consider the following game: two players start with two (equal) piles
of jellybeans in front of them. They take turns removing any positive
integer number of jellybeans at a time from one of two piles in front of
them in turns.</p>
<p>The player who removes the last jellybean wins the game.</p>
<p>Which player (if any) has a strategy to guarantee to win the
game?</p>
<p>Try out some games, starting with <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> jellybean in each pile, then <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> jellybeans in each pile, then <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span> jellybeans in each pile. Who wins in
each game?</p>
<p>Notice that reasoning about the strategy for the <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> jellybean game is easier than about the
strategy for the <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> jellybean
game.</p>
<p><span><em>Formulate a winning strategy by working to transform the
game to a simpler one we know we can win.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>Player 2’s Strategy</em></span>: Take the same number of
jellybeans that Player 1 did, but from the opposite pile.</p>
<p><span><em>Why is this a good idea</em></span>: If Player 2 plays this
strategy, at the next turn Player 1 faces a game with the same setup as
the original, just with fewer jellybeans in the two piles. Then Player 2
can keep playing this strategy to win.</p>
<p><span><strong>Claim</strong></span>: Player 2’s strategy guarantees
they will win the game.</p>
<p><span><strong>Proof</strong></span>: By strong induction, we will
prove that for all positive integers <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, Player 2’s strategy guarantees a win
in the game that starts with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
jellybeans in each pile.</p>
<p><span><strong>Basis step</strong></span>: WTS Player 2’s strategy
guarantees a win when each pile starts with <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> jellybean.</p>
<p>In this case, Player 1 has to take the jellybean from one of the
piles (because they can’t take from both piles at once). Following the
strategy, Player 2 takes the jellybean from the other pile, and wins
because this is the last jellybean.</p>
<p><span><strong>Recursive step</strong></span>: Let <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive integer. As the strong
induction hypothesis, assume that Player 2’s strategy guarantees a win
in the games where there are <span class="math inline">\(1, 2, \ldots,
n\)</span> many jellybeans in each pile at the start of the game.</p>
<p>WTS that Player 2’s strategy guarantees a win in the game where there
are <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> in the jellybeans in each
pile at the start of the game.</p>
<p>In this game, the first move has Player 1 take some number, call it
<span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> (where <span
class="math inline">\(1 \leq c \leq n+1\)</span>), of jellybeans from
one of the piles. Playing according to their strategy, Player 2 then
takes the same number of jellybeans from the other pile.</p>
<p>Notice that <span class="math inline">\((c = n+1) \lor (c \leq
n)\)</span>.</p>
<p><span><em>Case 1</em></span>: Assume <span class="math inline">\(c =
n+1\)</span>, then in their first move, Player 2 wins because they take
all of the second pile, which includes the last jellybean.</p>
<p><span><em>Case 2</em></span>: Assume <span class="math inline">\(c
\leq n\)</span>. Then after Player 2’s first move, the two piles have an
equal number of jellybeans. The number of jellybeans in each pile is
<span class="math display">\[(n+1) - c\]</span> and, since <span
class="math inline">\(1 \leq c \leq n\)</span>, this number is between
<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Thus, at this stage of the game, the
game appears identical to a new game where the two piles have an equal
number of jellybeans between <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Thus, the strong induction
hypothesis applies, and Player 2’s strategy guarantees they win.</p>
