</div>
<p><span><strong>Theorem</strong></span>: A robot on an infinite
2-dimensional integer grid starts at <span
class="math inline">\((0,0)\)</span> and at each step moves to
diagonally adjacent grid point. This robot can / cannot
<span>(<span><em>circle one</em></span>)</span> reach <span
class="math inline">\((1,0)\)</span>.</p>
<p><span><strong>Definition</strong></span> The set of positions the
robot can visit <span class="math inline">\(Pos\)</span> is defined by:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{ll}
    \textrm{Basis Step: } &amp; (0,0) \in Pos \\
    \textrm{Recursive Step: } &amp; \textrm{If } (x,y) \in Pos \textrm{,
then } \\
    &amp;\phantom{(x+1, y+1), (x+1, y-1), (x-1, y-1), (x-1, y+1)}
\textrm{ are also in } Pos
\end{array}\]</span></p>
<p><span><em>Example elements of <span
class="math inline">\(Pos\)</span> are</em></span>:</p>
<p><span><strong>Lemma</strong></span>: <span
class="math inline">\(\forall (x,y) \in Pos~~( x+y \textrm{ is an even
integer}~)\)</span></p>
<p><span><em>Why are we calling this a lemma?</em></span></p>
<p>Proof of theorem using lemma: To show is <span
class="math inline">\((1,0) \notin Pos\)</span>. Rewriting the lemma to
explicitly restrict the domain of the universal, we have <span
class="math inline">\(\forall (x,y) ~(~ (x,y) \in Pos~~  \to ~~(x+y
\textrm{ is an even integer})~)\)</span>. Since the universal is true,
<span class="math inline">\((~ (1,0) \in Pos~~ \to ~~(1+0 \textrm{ is an
even integer})~)\)</span> is a true statement. Evaluating the conclusion
of this conditional statement: By definition of long division, since
<span class="math inline">\(1 = 0 \cdot 2 + 1\)</span> (where <span
class="math inline">\(0 \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(1 \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(0 \leq 1 &lt; 2\)</span> mean that <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> is the quotient and <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is the remainder), <span
class="math inline">\(1 ~\textrm{\bf mod}~ 2 = 1\)</span> which is not
<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> so the conclusion is false. A
true conditional with a false conclusion must have a false hypothesis:
<span class="math inline">\((1,0) \notin Pos\)</span>, QED. <span
class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></p>
<p>Proof of lemma by structural induction:</p>
<p><span><strong>Basis Step</strong></span>:</p>
<p><span><strong>Recursive Step</strong></span>: Consider arbitrary
<span class="math inline">\((x,y) \in Pos\)</span>. To show is: <span
class="math display">\[(x+y \text{ is an even integer}) \to (\text{sum
of coordinates of next position is even integer})\]</span> Assume
<span><strong>as the induction hypothesis, IH</strong></span> that:</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="fundamental-theorem-proof">Fundamental
theorem proof</h1>
<p><span><strong>Theorem</strong></span>: Every positive integer
<span><em>greater than 1</em></span> is a product of (one or more)
primes.</p>
<p><span><strong>Before we prove, let’s try some
examples</strong></span>:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(20 =\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(100 =\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(5 =\)</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Proof by strong induction</strong></span>, with <span
class="math inline">\(b=2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(j=0\)</span>.</p>
<p><span><strong>Basis step</strong></span>: WTS property is true about
<span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> is itself prime, it is
already written as a product of (one) prime.</p>
<p><span><strong>Recursive step</strong></span>: Consider an arbitrary
integer <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 2\)</span>. Assume (as the
strong induction hypothesis, IH) that the property is true about each of
<span class="math inline">\(2, \ldots, n\)</span>. WTS that the property
is true about <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span>: We want to show
that <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> can be written as a
product of primes. Notice that <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span>
is itself prime or it is composite.</p>
<p><span><em>Case 1</em></span>: assume <span
class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> is prime and then immediately it is
written as a product of (one) prime so we are done.</p>
<p><span><em>Case 2</em></span>: assume that <span
class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> is composite so there are integers
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(n+1 =
xy\)</span> and each of them is between <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> (inclusive). Therefore, the induction
hypothesis applies to each of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> so each of these factors of <span
class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> can be written as a product of
primes. Multiplying these products together, we get a product of primes
that gives <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span>, as required.</p>
<p>Since both cases give the necessary conclusion, the proof by cases
for the recursive step is complete.</p>

<p>Suppose we had postage stamps worth <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span> cents and <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span> cents. Which number of cents can we
form using these stamps? In other words, which postage can we pay?</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(11\)</span>?</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(15\)</span>?</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>?</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    &amp;CanPay(0) \land \lnot CanPay(1) \land \lnot CanPay(2) \land \\
    &amp;CanPay(3) \land \lnot CanPay(4) \land CanPay(5) \land CanPay(6)
\\
    &amp;\lnot CanPay(7) \land \forall n \in \mathbb{Z}^{\geq 8}
CanPay(n)
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>where the predicate <span class="math inline">\(CanPay\)</span> with
domain <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> is <span
class="math display">\[CanPay(n) = \exists x \in \mathbb{N} \exists y
\in \mathbb{N}  ( 5x+3y = n)\]</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Proof</strong></span> (idea): First, explicitly give
witnesses or general arguments for postages between <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(7\)</span>. To prove the universal claim, we can
use mathematical induction or strong induction.</p>
<p><span><em>Approach 1, mathematical induction</em></span>: if we have
stamps that add up to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> cents, need
to use them (and others) to give <span
class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> cents. How do we get <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> cent with just <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-cent and <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span>-cent stamps?</p>
<p>Either <u>take away a <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>-cent
stamps and add two <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-cent
stamps</u>,</p>
<p>or <u>take away three <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-cent
stamps and add two <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>-cent
stamps</u>.</p>
<p>The details of this proof by mathematical induction are making sure
we have enough stamps to use one of these approaches.</p>
<p><span><em>Approach 2, strong induction</em></span>: assuming we know
how to make postage for <span><strong>all</strong></span> smaller values
(greater than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span>), when
we need to make <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> cents, <u>add
one <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> cent stamp to however we make
<span class="math inline">\((n+1) - 3\)</span> cents</u>.</p>
<p>The details of this proof by strong induction are making sure we stay
in the domain of the universal when applying the induction
hypothesis.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="strong-induction-nim">Strong induction

<p>Consider the following game: two players start with two (equal) piles
of jellybeans in front of them. They take turns removing any positive
integer number of jellybeans at a time from one of two piles in front of
them in turns.</p>
<p>The player who removes the last jellybean wins the game.</p>
<p>Which player (if any) has a strategy to guarantee to win the
game?</p>
<p>Try out some games, starting with <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> jellybean in each pile, then <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> jellybeans in each pile, then <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span> jellybeans in each pile. Who wins in
each game?</p>
<p>Notice that reasoning about the strategy for the <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> jellybean game is easier than about the
strategy for the <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> jellybean
game.</p>
<p><span><em>Formulate a winning strategy by working to transform the
game to a simpler one we know we can win.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>Player 2’s Strategy</em></span>: Take the same number of
jellybeans that Player 1 did, but from the opposite pile.</p>
<p><span><em>Why is this a good idea</em></span>: If Player 2 plays this
strategy, at the next turn Player 1 faces a game with the same setup as
the original, just with fewer jellybeans in the two piles. Then Player 2
can keep playing this strategy to win.</p>
<p><span><strong>Claim</strong></span>: Player 2’s strategy guarantees
they will win the game.</p>
<p><span><strong>Proof</strong></span>: By strong induction, we will
prove that for all positive integers <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, Player 2’s strategy guarantees a win
in the game that starts with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
jellybeans in each pile.</p>
<p><span><strong>Basis step</strong></span>: WTS Player 2’s strategy
guarantees a win when each pile starts with <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> jellybean.</p>
<p>In this case, Player 1 has to take the jellybean from one of the
piles (because they can’t take from both piles at once). Following the
strategy, Player 2 takes the jellybean from the other pile, and wins
because this is the last jellybean.</p>
<p><span><strong>Recursive step</strong></span>: Let <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive integer. As the strong
induction hypothesis, assume that Player 2’s strategy guarantees a win
in the games where there are <span class="math inline">\(1, 2, \ldots,
n\)</span> many jellybeans in each pile at the start of the game.</p>
<p>WTS that Player 2’s strategy guarantees a win in the game where there
are <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> in the jellybeans in each
pile at the start of the game.</p>
<p>In this game, the first move has Player 1 take some number, call it
<span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> (where <span
class="math inline">\(1 \leq c \leq n+1\)</span>), of jellybeans from
one of the piles. Playing according to their strategy, Player 2 then
takes the same number of jellybeans from the other pile.</p>
<p>Notice that <span class="math inline">\((c = n+1) \lor (c \leq
n)\)</span>.</p>
<p><span><em>Case 1</em></span>: Assume <span class="math inline">\(c =
n+1\)</span>, then in their first move, Player 2 wins because they take
all of the second pile, which includes the last jellybean.</p>
<p><span><em>Case 2</em></span>: Assume <span class="math inline">\(c
\leq n\)</span>. Then after Player 2’s first move, the two piles have an
equal number of jellybeans. The number of jellybeans in each pile is
<span class="math display">\[(n+1) - c\]</span> and, since <span
class="math inline">\(1 \leq c \leq n\)</span>, this number is between
<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Thus, at this stage of the game, the
game appears identical to a new game where the two piles have an equal
number of jellybeans between <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Thus, the strong induction
hypothesis applies, and Player 2’s strategy guarantees they win.</p>
