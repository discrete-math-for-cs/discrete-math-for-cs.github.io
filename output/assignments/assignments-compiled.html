<h1 class="title">HW1 Definitions and NotationProject</h1>
<p class="author">CSE20S24</p>
<p class="date">Due: Tuesday, October 5, 2021 at 11:00PM on
GradescopePart 1 due 10/14/21; Part 2 due 11/4/21; Part 3 due
12/2/21</p>
</header>
<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice reading and applying definitions to get comfortable
working with mathematical language. As a result, you can expect to spend
more time reading the questions and looking up notation than doing
calculations.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> Assignments
give you practice with the main concepts and techniques of the course,
while getting to know and learn from your classmates. These homework
assignments may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students.
You may switch HW partners for different HW assignments. Please ensure
your name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your
homework submission, start each question on a new page, and upload the
PDF to Gradescope.<br />
If you’re working in a group, <span><em>ubmit only one submission per
group</em></span>: one partner uploads the submission through their
Gradescope account and then adds the other group member(s) to the
Gradescope submission by selecting their name(s) in the “Add Group
Members” dialog box. You will need to re-add your group member(s) every
time you resubmit a new version of your assignment.<br />
Each homework question will be graded either for
<span><strong>correctness</strong></span> (including clear and precise
explanations and justifications of all answers) or <span><strong>fair
effort completeness</strong></span>. You may collaborate on “graded for
correctness” questions only with CSE 20 students in your group; if your
group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours
or post a private post (visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza. For
“graded for completeness” questions: collaboration is allowed with any
CSE 20 students this quarter; if your group has questions about a
problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a public post on
Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines, we
recommend using Flap.js or JFLAP. Photographs of clearly hand-drawn
diagrams may also be used. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw1-definitions-and-notation”.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics you are
working with for this assignment, see the class material from Week 0 and
1. We will post frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a
pinned Piazza post.</p>
<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span><a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>)
Each of the sets below is described using set builder notation or as a
result of set operations applied to other known sets. Rewrite them using
the roster method.</p>
<p>Remember our discussions of data-types: use clear notation that is
consistent with our class notes and definitions to communicate the
data-types of the elements in each set.</p>
<hr />
<p><span><em>Sample response that can be used as reference for the
detail expected in your answer:</em></span></p>
<p>The set <span class="math inline">\(\{ \texttt{A}\} \circ \{
\texttt{A}\texttt{U}, \texttt{A}\texttt{C},
\texttt{A}\texttt{G}\}\)</span> can be written using the roster method
as <span class="math display">\[\{ \texttt{A}\texttt{A}\texttt{U},
\texttt{A}\texttt{A}\texttt{C},
\texttt{A}\texttt{A}\texttt{G}\}\]</span> because set-wise concatenation
gives a set whose elements are all possible results of concatenating an
element of the left set with an element of the right set. Since the left
set in this example only has one element (<span
class="math inline">\(\texttt{A}\)</span>), each of the elements of the
set we described starts with <span
class="math inline">\(\texttt{A}\)</span>. There are three elements of
this set, one for each of the distinct elements of the right set.</p>
<hr />
<ol>
<li><p><span class="math display">\[\{ x \in S \mid rnalen(x) = 1 \}
\circ \{x \in S \mid rnalen(x) = 1 \}\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is the set of RNA strands and <span
class="math inline">\(rnalen\)</span> is the recursively defined
function that we discussed in class.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math display">\[\{ (r,g,b) \in C \mid r+g+b =
1\}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(C = \{ (r,g,b) \mid 0
\leq r \leq 255, 0 \leq g \leq 255, 0 \leq b \leq 255, r \in \mathbb{N},
g \in \mathbb{N}, b \in \mathbb{N} \}\)</span> is the set that you
worked with in Monday’s review quiz.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math display">\[\{ a \in \mathbb{Z} \mid  a \textbf{

<ol>
<li><p>In Wednesday’s review quiz, you considered some attempted
recursive definitions for the function with domain <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> and with codomain <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> which gives <span
class="math inline">\(2^n\)</span> for each <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Write out a correct recursive
definition of this function.</p></li>
<li><p>How would your answer to part (a) change if we consider a new
function with the same domain and rule but whose codomain is <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>?</p></li>
<li><p>How would your answer to part (a) change if we consider a new
function with the same codomain and rule but whose domain is <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>?</p></li>
<li><p>Write a recursive definition of the function with domain <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}^+\)</span>, codomain <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}^+\)</span> and which gives <span
class="math inline">\(n!\)</span> for each <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. The <span
class="math inline">\(!\)</span> symbol is the “factorial” symbol and
means that we need to multiple <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> by
each of the integers between it and <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> inclusive. For example, <span
class="math inline">\(5! = 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 =
120\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Recall the
function <span class="math inline">\(d_0\)</span> which takes an ordered
pair of ratings <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuples and
returns a measure of the distance between them given by <span
class="math display">\[d_0 (~(~ (x_1, x_2, x_3), (y_1, y_2, y_3) ~) ~) =
\sqrt{ (x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2 + (x_3 -y_3)^2}\]</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span><em>Sample response that can be used as reference for the
detail expected in your answers for this question:</em> </span></p>
<p>To give an example of two <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuples that are <span
class="math inline">\(d_0\)</span> distance <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> from each other, consider the <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuples <span
class="math inline">\((1,0,0)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\((0,0,0)\)</span>. We calculate the function
application: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    d_0 (~(~ (1, 0,0), (0,0,0) ~) ~) &amp;= \sqrt{ (1 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2
+ (0 -0)^2} = \sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{1} = 1,
\end{aligned}\]</span> which is the result required for this
example.</p>
<hr />
<ol>
<li><p>Give an example of three <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuples <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    &amp;(x_{1,1}, x_{1,2}, x_{1,3}) \\
    &amp;(x_{2,1}, x_{2,2}, x_{2,3}) \\
    &amp;(x_{3,1}, x_{3,2}, x_{3,3}) \\
    
\end{aligned}\]</span> that are all <span
class="math inline">\(d_0\)</span> distance <span><strong>greater
than</strong></span> <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> from each
other. In other words, for each <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> between <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span> (with <span class="math inline">\(i
\neq j\)</span>), <span class="math display">\[d_{0}(~(~(x_{i,1},
x_{i,2}, x_{i,3})  , (x_{j,1}, x_{j,2}, x_{j,3})~)~) &gt; 1\]</span></p>
<p>Your answer should include <span><strong>both</strong></span>
specific values for each example <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuple <span><strong>and</strong></span>
a justification of your examples with (clear, correct, complete)
calculations and/or references to definitions and connecting them with
the desired conclusion.<br />
<span><em>To think about</em></span>: how will you justify that the
square root of a number is greater than <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>? Are calculations from a calculator
accurate enough to help us?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the range of values that results from applying the
function <span class="math inline">\(d_0\)</span> to ordered pairs of
<span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuple ratings? That is, what are
the smallest and largest possible results?</p>
<p>Your answer should include <span><strong>both</strong></span>
specific values for the smallest and largest possible results

</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>The project component of this class will be an opportunity for you to
extend your work on assignments and explore applications of your
choosing.</p>
<p><span><em>Why?</em></span> To go deeper and explore the material from
discrete math and how it relates to Computer Science.</p>
<p><span><em>How?</em></span> During emergency remote instruction last
academic year, we discovered that video assessement and some open-ended
personalized projects help ensure fairness and can be less stressful for
students than in-person midterm exams. Asynchronous project submission
also gives flexibility and allows more physical distancing.</p>
<p>Your videos: We will delete all the videos we receive from you after
assigning final grades for the course, and they will be stored in a
university-controlled Google Drive directory only accessible to the
course staff during the quarter. Please send an email to the instructor
(minnes@eng.ucsd.edu) if you have concerns about the video / screencast
components of this project or cannot complete projects in this style for
some reason.</p>
<p>You may produce screencasts with any software you choose. One option
is to record yourself with Zoom; a tutorial on how to use Zoom to record
a screencast (courtesy of Prof. Joe Politz) is here:</p>
<p><a

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="what-resources-can-you-use">What resources
can you use?</h2>
<p>This project must be completed individually, without any help from
other people, including the course staff (other than logistics support
if you get stuck with screencast).</p>
<p>You can use any of this quarter’s CSE 20 offering (notes, readings,
class videos, homework feedback). These resources should be more than
enough. If you are struggling to get started and want to look elsewhere
online, you must acknowledge this by listing and citing any resources
you consult (even if you do not explicitly quote them). Link directly to
them and include the name of the author / video creator and the reason
you consulted this reference. The work you submit for the project needs
to be your own. Again, you shouldn’t need to look anywhere other than
this quarter’s material and doing so may result in definitions or
notations that conflict with our norms in this class so think carefully
before you go down this path.</p>
<p>The project has three parts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Part 1 of Project: due Thursday October 14</p></li>
<li><p>Part 2 of Project: due Thursday November 4</p></li>
<li><p>Part 3 of Project: due Thursday December 2</p></li>

<ol>
<li><p>In Week 1, we discussed the mathematical definition of a
function, namely that a <span><strong>function</strong></span> is
defined by its (1) domain, (2) codomain, and (3) rule assigning each
element in the domain exactly one element in the codomain.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Write out the definition for an example function you make up. You
can choose any example you like, so long as it is your own independent
effort and it is not a function from a class example, homework, or
Review Quiz in this class so far. Use the notation defined in class.
Label and define the domain, codomain, and rule clearly.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the result of applying your function to an element in
its domain. Just like in homework, include (clear, correct, complete)
calculations and/or references to definitions to present your function
application.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>In CSE 20 this quarter, we will be exploring the applications of
discrete mathematics for core CS topics. The following videos introduce
some of these topics and the work happening here at UCSD to explore
them. Pick one of the following videos, watch it, and then write a few
sentences answering the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Which video did you watch? Why did you choose the video you
watched?</p></li>
<li><p>What followup question(s) would you like to ask the person in the
video about their work? At least one of your followup questions should
be about a technical aspect of the work that you would like to learn
more about.</p></li>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="video-component">Video component</h3>
<p>Presenting your reasoning and demonstrating it via screenshare are
important skills that also show us a lot of your learning. Getting
practice with this style of presentation is a good thing for you to
learn in general and a rich way for us to assess your skills.</p>
<p>Prepare a 3-5 minute screencast video that starts with your face and
your student ID for a few seconds at the beginning, and introduce
yourself audibly while on screen. You don’t have to be on camera for the
rest of the video, though it’s fine if you are. We are looking for a
brief confirmation that it’s you creating the video and doing the work
submitted for the project.</p>
<p>Then, explain your work in question 1 of the written component.
Discuss at least one potential mistake that someone solving a similar
question should avoid (this could be a mistake you made while thinking
about this problem or something you anticipate a classmate might
struggle with); explain why the mistake is wrong and how to fix it.</p>
<p>Finally, explain any differences between your pre-survey description
of “what a function is" and the mathematical definition of what a
function is. You should have an email copy of your responses to the
pre-survey, and you can refer to what you wrote in your explanation.</p>
<p>Use this Google form</p>

<p>to directly upload a video file for this assignment. It should be a
file that you can easily play on your system. One way you can determine
if this is true is if you can store it on your Google Drive and play it
from there, since that’s how we will watch it.</p>

<li><p>In this part of the project, you will select one question from
one of the review quizzes from 10/4/2021 (Monday of Week 1) to
10/29/2021 (Friday of Week 5) to revisit. Include the problem statement,
why you picked this question (e.g. what is interesting about it, what is
hard about it, or why you wanted to take a second look at it), and your
solution.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Question selection: you can pick any <span><strong>one
question</strong></span> listed in the Review sections of the relevant
notes documents, and you must address all of its parts.</p></li>
<li><p>For each part of your chosen question: prepare a complete
solution (you can use the homework solutions we post for guidance about
the style). Your submission will be evaluated not only on the
correctness of your answers, but on your ability to present your ideas
clearly and logically. You should explain how you arrived at your
conclusions, using mathematically sound reasoning. Your goal should be
to convince the reader that your results and methods are sound. Imagine
you are preparing these solutions for someone else taking CSE 20 who
missed that week and is “catching up".</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In this part of the project, you’ll consider the importance of
data types and precision in Computer Science. Read three articles</p>
<p>(1) This discussion of the causes of a wide-spread problem in
published genomics papers</p>

<p>In one or two sentences, summarize the main lesson you draw from each
article.</p>
<p>Thinking back to your own experiences, give an example of when you
used computers or Computer Science to help you *avoid* an error. Also,
give an example when your use of computers or Computer Science *caused*
an error.</p>
<p>What measures do you take to increase your confidence in the results
of your own human and digital (i.e. machine) computation? Why do you
think these are sufficient?</p></li>

<p>Presenting your reasoning and demonstrating it via screenshare are
important skills that also show us a lot of your learning. Getting
practice with this style of presentation is a good thing for you to
learn in general and a rich way for us to assess your skills.</p>
<p>Prepare a 3-5 minute screencast video explaining your work in
question 1 of the written component. During your solution presentation,
point out at least one potential mistake that someone solving a similar
question should avoid (this could be a mistake you made while thinking
about this problem or something you anticipate a classmate might
struggle with); explain why the mistake is wrong and how to fix it.</p>
<p>You do not need to include complete details of every part of your
solution. It is up to you to choose what is most important so that you
can stick to the timing guidelines and still have time to include
discussing potential mistakes.</p>
<p>Include your face and your student ID (we’d like a photo ID that
includes your name and picture if possible) for a few seconds at the
beginning, and introduce yourself audibly while on screen. You don’t
have to be on camera the whole time, though it’s fine if you are. We are
looking for a brief confirmation that it’s you creating the video/doing
the work attached to the video.</p>
