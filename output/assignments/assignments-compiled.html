<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice reading and applying definitions to get comfortable
working with mathematical language.</p>
<p><span><strong>Relevant class material</strong></span>: Week 1.</p>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw1-definitions-and-notation”.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> These homework
assignments may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students.
Please ensure your name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first
page of your homework submission, start each question on a new page, and
upload the PDF to Gradescope. If you’re working in a group,
<span><em>submit only one submission per group</em></span>: one partner
uploads the submission through their Gradescope account and then adds
the other group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting
their name(s) in the “Add Group Members” dialog box. You will need to
re-add your group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of
your assignment.</p>
<p>Each homework question will be graded either for
<span><strong>correctness</strong></span> (including clear and precise
explanations and justifications of all answers) or <span><strong>fair
effort completeness</strong></span>. You may collaborate on “graded for
correctness” questions only with CSE 20 students in your group; if your
group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours
or post a private post (visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza. For
“graded for completeness” questions: collaboration is allowed with any
CSE 20 students this quarter; if your group has questions about a
problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a public post on
Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>

class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> In
class, we used <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>-tuples to
represent the user ratings for four movies. This representation is
memory-efficient because we use the order of the components in the <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span>-tuples to represent which move is being
rated. However, it is not easily extended when we want to add new movies
to the database. Define a new model that would allow us to represent the
user ratings of movie databases where we allow for new movies to be
added. Use only the data types we have talked about in class: sets,
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuples, and strings. Explain the
design choices that you used to define your model by referencing
properties of the data-type(s) you choose. Demonstrate your model by
showing how the rating of the user who dislikes Dune and Oppenheimer and

<p>(This is the same definition as in the Week 1 Review quiz.)</p>
<p>Can you find two different <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuples that represent colors that are
indistinguishable to your eye? You can use the website in the footnote
to play around with different choices of red, green, and blue levels to
see if you can distinguish between the resulting colors. Why or why
not?</p>
<p>A complete answer will include the specific example <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuples that work, along with a
description of the colors that they represent and why they are
indistinguishable, or an explanation of why there can’t be such an
example.</p></li>

Each of the sets below is described using set builder notation or
recursion or as a result of set operations applied to other known sets.
Rewrite each of the sets using the roster method.</p>
<p>Remember our discussions of data-types: use clear notation that is
consistent with our class notes and definitions to communicate the
data-types of the elements in each set.</p>

<p>The set <span class="math inline">\(\{ \texttt{A}\} \circ \{
\texttt{A}\texttt{U}, \texttt{A}\texttt{C},

as <span class="math display">\[\{ \texttt{A}\texttt{A}\texttt{U},
\texttt{A}\texttt{A}\texttt{C},
\texttt{A}\texttt{A}\texttt{G}\}\]</span> because set-wise concatenation
gives a set whose elements are all possible results of concatenating an
element of the left set with an element of the right set. Since the left
set in this example only has one element, namely <span
class="math inline">\(\texttt{A}\)</span>, each of the elements of the
set we described starts with <span
class="math inline">\(\texttt{A}\)</span>. There are three elements of
this set, one for each of the distinct elements of the right set.</p>

<p>Define a <span><strong>new</strong></span> function which we’ll call

it.</p></li>

<li><p>Multiple representations</p>
<p>Recall that, mathematically, a color can be represented as a <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuple <span class="math inline">\((r,
g, b)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> represents
the red component, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> the green
component, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> the blue component and
where each of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>
must be from the collection <span class="math inline">\(\{x \in
\mathbb{N}\mid 0 \leq x \leq 255 \}\)</span>. As an alternative
representation, in this assignment we’ll use base <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> fixed-width expansions to represent
colors as individual numbers (this definition was introduced in this
week’s Review quiz).</p>
<p><span><strong>Definition</strong></span>: A <span><strong>hex
color</strong></span> is a nonnegative integer, <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, that has a base <span
class="math inline">\(16\)</span> fixed-width <span
class="math inline">\(6\)</span> expansion <span
class="math display">\[n = (r_1r_2g_1g_2b_1b_2)_{16,6}\]</span> where
<span class="math inline">\((r_1r_2)_{16,2}\)</span> is the red
component, <span class="math inline">\((g_1g_2)_{16,2}\)</span> is the
green component, and <span
class="math inline">\((b_1b_2)_{16,2}\)</span> is the blue.</p>
<p>For this question, let’s call the set of hex colors <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span>. In the Week 2 Review quiz (Question
3d), we explored a few different set builder definitions for <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Rewrite the set
builder definition of a set below so that it refers to colors rather
than numbers: <span class="math inline">\(\{ c \in H \mid c \mod 256 =
0\}\)</span>. A complete answer will justify the new set builder
definition by connection with the definition of hex colors and how it
impacts the colors that satisfy the specific property for this
set.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Rewrite the set
builder definition of a set below so that it refers to colors rather
than numbers: <span class="math inline">\(\{ c \in H \mid c &lt;
65536\}\)</span>. A complete answer will justify the new set builder
definition by connection with the definition of hex colors and how it
impacts the colors that satisfy the specific property for this
set.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) In art, we can mix
two colors to get a new color. For example, red and blue make purple,
blue and yellow make green, red and yellow make orange. A mathematical
definition of <span><strong>hex color mixing</strong></span> would be a
function with domain <span class="math inline">\(H \times H\)</span> and
codomain <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> where the result of
applying this function to an input <span class="math inline">\((n_1,
n_2)\)</span> is the hex color that results from mixing the hex colors
<span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p><span><em>Sample work for a related question that can be used as
reference for the detail expected in your answer:</em></span> Consider
the attempted mathematical definition <span class="math inline">\(f_1:
H\times H \to H\)</span> given by <span class="math display">\[f_1
(~(n_1, n_2) ~) = n_1 + n_2\]</span> We will show that this function is
not well-defined so it cannot give a hex color mixing definition. The
reason it is not well-defined is that the application of the rule
sometimes gives values that are not in the stated codomain. To see this,
we need an example input to <span class="math inline">\(f_1\)</span> for
which the output of the rule is not in <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span>. Here is one such example: <span
class="math inline">\((n_1, n_2) = (~(FFFFFF)_{16,6},
(FFFFFF)_{16,6}~)\)</span>. This example is in <span
class="math inline">\(H \times H\)</span> because <span
class="math inline">\((FFFFFF)_{16,6}\)</span> is a nonnegative integer
that has a base <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span> fixed-width
<span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> expansion so it is a hex color.
We now apply the definition of the rule in <span
class="math inline">\(f_1\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
f_1 (~(n_1, n_2) ~) &amp;=  f_1 ( (~(FFFFFF)_{16,6}, (FFFFFF)_{16,6}~) )
= (FFFFFF)_{16,6} + (FFFFFF)_{16,6} \\
&amp;= 2 \left( 15\cdot 16^5 + 15\cdot 16^4 + 15 \cdot 16^3 + 15 \cdot
16^2 + 15 \cdot 16^1 + 15 \cdot 16^0 \right) \\
&amp;= 2 \cdot 15 \cdot (1048576 + 65536 + 4096 + 256 + 16 + 1) = 2
\cdot 15 \cdot 1118481 = 33554430
\end{aligned}\]</span> This is not a hex color because it is greater
than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(16^6 = 16777216\)</span>,
so (using the Week 2 notes on which numbers can be represented with
fixed-width expansions) it does not have a hexadecimal
<span><strong>fixed width <span
class="math inline">\(6\)</span></strong></span> expansion.</p>
<hr />
<p>In this question, we’ll look at another attempted mathematical
definition for hex color mixing. We define <span
class="math inline">\(f_2: H\times H \to H\)</span> given by <span
class="math display">\[f_2 (~(n_1, n_2) ~) = (n_1 + n_2) \textbf{ div }
2\]</span></p>
<p>This is a well-defined function. You do not need to prove this or
hand it in, but it’s good practice to make sure you understand why it’s
well-defined. Notice that the function application <span
class="math display">\[f_2 ( ~(~ (FF0000)_{16,6} , (FFFE00)_{16,6}
~)~)\]</span> can be calculated as: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
f_2&amp;(((FF0000)_{16,6}, (FFFE00)_{16,6}))=
((FF0000)_{16,6} + (FFFE00)_{16,6})) \textbf{ div } 2\\
&amp;= \big(~ \left(15\cdot16^5 + 15\cdot16^4 + 0\cdot16^3 + 0\cdot16^2
+ 0\cdot16^1 + 0\cdot16^0 \right) \\
&amp;~~~~+~
    \left((15\cdot16^5 + 15\cdot16^4 + 15\cdot16^3 + 14\cdot16^2 +
0\cdot16^1 + 0\cdot16^0\right )~\big )\textbf{ div } 2\\
&amp;= (16711680 + 16776704) \textbf{ div } 2 = 33488384 \textbf{ div }
2 = 16744192
\end{aligned}\]</span> Since this is less than <span
class="math inline">\(16^6 = 16777216\)</span>, we can represent it
using base <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span> fixed-width <span
class="math inline">\(6\)</span>:. <span
class="math display">\[(16744192)_{10} = 15\cdot16^5 + 15\cdot16^4 +
7\cdot16^3 + 15\cdot16^2 + 0\cdot16^1 + 0\cdot16^0 =
(FF7F00)_{16,6}\]</span></p>
<p>Using the web tool <a
href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp"
class="uri">https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp</a>, we can
verify that <span class="math inline">\((FF0000)_{16,6}\)</span> is red,
<span class="math inline">\((FFFE00)_{16,6}\)</span> is yellow, and
<span class="math inline">\((FF7F00)_{16,6}\)</span> is orange.</p>
<p>Show that <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> does not work as a
hex color mixing definition by finding another ordered pair of hex
colors for which the result of applying <span
class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> does not give the expected hex color.
Include the numerical description of each colors you mention, alongside
a description of them in English. Describe how you know what these
colors are (if you use a web color tool, include its URL in your
submission writeup; if not, describe your reasoning). Justify your
example with (clear, correct, complete) calculations and/or references
to definitions, and connecting them with the desired

<li><p>Logical Equivalence. Imagine a friend suggests the following
argument to you: “The compound proposition <span
class="math display">\[(x \lor y) \land z\]</span> is logically
equivalent to <span class="math display">\[x \lor (y \land z)\]</span>
because I can transform one to the other using the following sequence of
logical equivalences: <span class="math display">\[(x \lor y) \land z
\equiv
           (x \lor (y \land y)) \land z \equiv
           x \lor ( (y \lor y) \land z) \equiv x \lor (y \land
z)\]</span> because <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is logically
equivalent to both <span class="math inline">\(y \land y\)</span> and to
<span class="math inline">\(y \lor y\)</span>".</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Prove to your
friend that they made a mistake by giving a truth assignment to the

that the two compound propositions <span class="math inline">\((x \lor
y) \land z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x \lor (y \land
z)\)</span> have different truth values. Justify your choice by
evaluating these compound propositions using the definitions of the
logical connectives and include enough intermediate steps so that a
student in CSE 20 who may be struggling with the material can still
follow along with your reasoning.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Help your friend
find the problem in their argument by pointing out which step(s) were
incorrect.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Give
<span><strong>three</strong></span> different compound propositions that
are actually logically equivalent to (and not the same as) <span
class="math display">\[(x \lor y) \land z\]</span> Justify each one of
these logical equivalences either by applying a sequence of logical
equivalences or using a truth table. Notice that you can use other
logical operators (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(\lnot, \lor, \land,
\oplus, \to,
        \leftrightarrow\)</span>) when constructing your compound
propositions.</p>
<p><span><em>Bonus; not for credit (do not hand in)</em></span>: How
would you translate each of the equivalent compound propositions in
English? Does doing so help illustrate why they are equivalent?</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p><span><strong>In this assignment</strong></span>, you will use
propositional and predicate logic to evaluate statements and arguments.
You will analyze statements and determine if they are true or false
using valid proof strategies. You will also determine if candidate
arguments are valid.</p>
<p><span><strong>Relevant class material</strong></span>: Weeks
4,5,6.</p>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw4-proofs-and-sets”.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> These homework
assignments may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students.
Please ensure your name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first
page of your homework submission, start each question on a new page, and
upload the PDF to Gradescope. If you’re working in a group,
<span><em>submit only one submission per group</em></span>: one partner
uploads the submission through their Gradescope account and then adds
the other group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting
their name(s) in the “Add Group Members” dialog box. You will need to
re-add your group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of
your assignment.</p>
<p>Each homework question will be graded either for
<span><strong>correctness</strong></span> (including clear and precise
explanations and justifications of all answers) or <span><strong>fair
effort completeness</strong></span>. You may collaborate on “graded for
correctness” questions only with CSE 20 students in your group; if your
group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours
or post a private post (visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza. For
“graded for completeness” questions: collaboration is allowed with any
CSE 20 students this quarter; if your group has questions about a
problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a public post on
Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In your proofs and disproofs of statements below, justify each step
by reference to a component of the following proof strategies we have
discussed so far, and/or to relevant definitions and calculations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A counterexample can be used to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(\forall x P(x)\)</span> is
<span><strong>false</strong></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>A witness can be used to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(\exists x P(x)\)</span> is
<span><strong>true</strong></span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of universal by exhaustion</strong></span>:
To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \, P(x)\)</span> is
true when <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> has a finite domain,
evaluate the predicate at <span><strong>each</strong></span> domain
element to confirm that it is always T.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by universal generalization</strong></span>:
To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \, P(x)\)</span> is
true, we can take an arbitrary element <span
class="math inline">\(e\)</span> from the domain and show that <span
class="math inline">\(P(e)\)</span> is true, without making any
assumptions about <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> other than that
it comes from the domain.</p></li>
<li><p>To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\exists x P(x)\)</span>
is <span><strong>false</strong></span>, write the universal statement
that is logically equivalent to its negation and then prove it true
using universal generalization.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Strategies for conjunction</strong></span>: To
prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span> is true, have
two subgoals: subgoal (1) prove <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
is true; and, subgoal (2) prove <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>
is true. To prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span> is
false, it’s enough to prove that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
is false. To prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span>
is false, it’s enough to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is false.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of Conditional by Direct
Proof</strong></span>: To prove that the implication <span
class="math inline">\(p \to q\)</span> is true, we can assume <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is true and use that assumption to show
<span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is true.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of Conditional by Contrapositive
Proof</strong></span>: To prove that the implication <span
class="math inline">\(p \to q\)</span> is true, we can assume <span
class="math inline">\(\neg q\)</span> is true and use that assumption to
show <span class="math inline">\(\neg p\)</span> is true.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by Cases</strong></span>: To prove <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> when we know <span
class="math inline">\(p_1 \lor p_2\)</span>, show that <span
class="math inline">\(p_1 \to q\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(p_2 \to q\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Evaluating predicates. Consider the following predicates, each of
which has as its domain the set of all bitstrings whose leftmost bit is
<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(E(x)\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> exactly when <span
class="math inline">\((x)_{2}\)</span> is even, and is <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> otherwise</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(L(x)\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> exactly when <span
class="math inline">\((x)_2 &lt; 15\)</span>, and is <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> otherwise</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(M(x)\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> exactly when <span
class="math inline">\((x)_2 &gt; 2\)</span> and is <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> otherwise.</p>
<hr />
<p><span><em>Sample response that can be used as reference for the
detail expected in your answer:</em></span> To prove that the statement
<span class="math display">\[\forall x ~L(x)\]</span> is false, we can
use the counterexample <span class="math inline">\(x = 1111\)</span>,
which is a bitstring whose leftmost bit is <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> (so is in the domain). Applying the
definition of <span class="math inline">\(L(x)\)</span>, since <span
class="math inline">\((1111)_2 = 1 \cdot 2^3 + 1\cdot 2^2 + 1 \cdot 2^1
+ 1 \cdot 2^0 = 8 + 4+2+1 = 15\)</span> which is not (strictly) less
than <span class="math inline">\(15\)</span>, we have that <span
class="math inline">\(L(1111) = F\)</span> and so the universal
statement is false.</p>

<span class="math inline">\(\{1,2\} \in \{ X \in W ~|~ 1 \in X

elements of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> which have <span

set, elements of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> are subsets of
<span class="math inline">\(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\)</span>. Since each element
in <span class="math inline">\(\{1,2\}\)</span> is an element of <span
class="math inline">\(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\{1,2\}\)</span> is a subset of <span

<span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>. Also, by roster method, <span
class="math inline">\(1 \in \{1,2\}\)</span>. Thus, <span
class="math inline">\(\{1,2\}\)</span> satisfies the conditions for
membership in <span class="math inline">\(\{ X \in W ~|~ 1 \in X
\}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, by set builder notation, elements in <span
class="math inline">\(\{ X \in W ~|~ 2 \in X \}\)</span> have to be
elements of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> which have <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> as an element. By definition of power
set, elements of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> are subsets of
<span class="math inline">\(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\)</span>. Since each element
in <span class="math inline">\(\{1,2\}\)</span> is an element of <span

class="math inline">\(\{1,2\}\)</span> is a subset of <span

<span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>. Also, by roster method, <span

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) A Venn diagram is
a chart of overlapping regions that illustrates the similarities
differences of a collection of sets. You may have seen some examples in

<p>Mostly we see Venn Diagrams with 2 or 3 circles (or other shapes). In
this question, we consider how to draw a Venn Diagram with 4
regions.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Here is a Venn Diagram with 2 circles. Each region is labelled
(encoded) with a binary string with 2 bits. Notice that there are four
regions: the region outside of the two circles, the region inside the
left circle and not the right circle, the region inside the right circle
and not the left circle, and the region inside both circles.</p>
<div class="center">
<p><img src="../../resources/images/VennDiagram2Circles.png"

</div>
<p>Generalize this encoding by encoding each region in this 3 circle
Venn Diagram with a unique binary string with 3 bits.</p>
<div class="center">
<p><img src="../../resources/images/VennDiagram3Circles.png"
style="width:1.5in" alt="image" /></p>
</div></li>
<li><p>Give an alternate representation of the regions in the 2 circle
and 3 circle Venn Diagrams by labelling each circle with a letter (<span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, or <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span

class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, for example) and then expressing each
region as the result of combining these with set operations (like union,
intersection, and set difference).</p></li>
<li><p>Here are two attempts at a Venn Diagram with 4 shapes, one with
circles and the other with ellipses.</p>

<p>Is there anything missing from either diagram? (How many regions are
there? How many regions should there be in order to use each 4 bit
binary string exactly once in a generalization of the encoding we saw
before?) If you had to choose one of these diagrams, which would you
choose, and why?</p></li>

<p><span><strong>In this assignment</strong></span>, you will work with
recursively defined sets and functions and prove properties about them,
practicing induction and other proof strategies.</p>
<p><span><strong>Relevant class material</strong></span>: Weeks
5,6,7.</p>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw5-proofs-and-induction”.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> These homework
assignments may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students.
Please ensure your name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first
page of your homework submission, start each question on a new page, and
upload the PDF to Gradescope. If you’re working in a group,
<span><em>submit only one submission per group</em></span>: one partner
uploads the submission through their Gradescope account and then adds
the other group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting
their name(s) in the “Add Group Members” dialog box. You will need to
re-add your group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of
your assignment.</p>
<p>Each homework question will be graded either for
<span><strong>correctness</strong></span> (including clear and precise
explanations and justifications of all answers) or <span><strong>fair
effort completeness</strong></span>. You may collaborate on “graded for
correctness” questions only with CSE 20 students in your group; if your
group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours
or post a private post (visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza. For
“graded for completeness” questions: collaboration is allowed with any
CSE 20 students this quarter; if your group has questions about a
problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a public post on
Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In your proofs and disproofs of statements below, justify each step
by reference to a component of the following proof strategies we have
discussed so far, and/or to relevant definitions and calculations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A counterexample can be used to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(\forall x P(x)\)</span> is
<span><strong>false</strong></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>A witness can be used to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(\exists x P(x)\)</span> is
<span><strong>true</strong></span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of universal by exhaustion</strong></span>:
To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \, P(x)\)</span> is
true when <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> has a finite domain,
evaluate the predicate at <span><strong>each</strong></span> domain
element to confirm that it is always T.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by universal generalization</strong></span>:
To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \, P(x)\)</span> is
true, we can take an arbitrary element <span
class="math inline">\(e\)</span> from the domain and show that <span
class="math inline">\(P(e)\)</span> is true, without making any
assumptions about <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> other than that
it comes from the domain.</p></li>
<li><p>To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\exists x P(x)\)</span>
is <span><strong>false</strong></span>, write the universal statement
that is logically equivalent to its negation and then prove it true
using universal generalization.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Strategies for conjunction</strong></span>: To
prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span> is true, have
two subgoals: subgoal (1) prove <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
is true; and, subgoal (2) prove <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>
is true. To prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span> is
false, it’s enough to prove that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
is false. To prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span>
is false, it’s enough to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is false.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of Conditional by Direct
Proof</strong></span>: To prove that the implication <span
class="math inline">\(p \to q\)</span> is true, we can assume <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is true and use that assumption to show
<span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is true.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of Conditional by Contrapositive
Proof</strong></span>: To prove that the implication <span
class="math inline">\(p \to q\)</span> is true, we can assume <span
class="math inline">\(\neg q\)</span> is true and use that assumption to
show <span class="math inline">\(\neg p\)</span> is true.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by Cases</strong></span>: To prove <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> when we know <span
class="math inline">\(p_1 \lor p_2\)</span>, show that <span
class="math inline">\(p_1 \to q\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(p_2 \to q\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by Structural Induction</strong></span>: To
prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \in X \, P(x)\)</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a recursively defined
set, prove two cases:</p>

<li><p>Statement: “the sum of the first <span

<p><span><strong>Attempted Proof:</strong> </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Base Case: <span class="math inline">\(n = 1\)</span><br />
First odd number is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>; <span
class="math inline">\(1^2 = 1\)</span>. True.<br />
<span class="math inline">\((n + 1)^2 = n^2 + 2n + 1\)</span><br />
<span class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span> is the sum of the first <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> odd numbers, and <span
class="math inline">\(2n + 1\)</span> is the next odd number in the
sequence, therefore <span class="math inline">\((n + 1)^2 =\)</span> the
sum of the first <span class="math inline">\(n + 1\)</span> odd
numbers.</p>

<li><p>Statement: “For every nonnegative integer <span

n\)</span>." (Recall that the <span class="math inline">\(\mid\)</span>
symbol is used to mean “divides” or “is a factor of”.)</p>
<p><span><strong>Attempted Proof:</strong> </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Attempted Proof: We proceed by strong mathematical induction.</p>
<p><span><em>Basis step:</em></span> Indeed, <span
class="math inline">\(3 | 0\)</span> because there is an integer, namely
<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(0 = 3\cdot 0\)</span>.</p>
<p><span><em>Induction step:</em></span> Let <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> be arbitrary. Assume, as the strong
induction hypothesis, that for all nonnegative integers <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq
j \leq k\)</span>, that <span class="math inline">\(3 | j\)</span>.
Write <span class="math inline">\(k+1 = m + n\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(m,n\)</span> are integers less than <span
class="math inline">\(k+1\)</span>. By the induction hypothesis, <span
class="math inline">\(3 | m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(3 |
n\)</span>. That is, there are integers <span
class="math inline">\(a,b\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(m = 3a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n=3b\)</span>. Therefore, <span
class="math inline">\(k+1 = (3a) + (3b) = 3 (a+b)\)</span>. We can
choose <span class="math inline">\(a + b\)</span>, where we know <span
class="math inline">\(a + b \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>, to show that <span
class="math inline">\(3 | (k+1)\)</span>, as required.</p>

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Games and
induction. The game of Nim-Var is a two-player game (which is a variant
of Nim). At the start of the game, there are two piles, each containing
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> jelly beans (<span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is a positive integer). On a player’s
turn, that player picks one of the two piles and does
<span><strong>one</strong></span> of the following: either</p>
<ul>
<li><p>removes some positive number of jelly beans from that pile,
<span><strong>or</strong></span></p></li>
<li><p>moves some positive number of jelly beans (that is less than the
current total number of jelly beans in the pile) from that pile to the
other. <span><em>Note: if there is only one jelly bean left in a pile,
the player cannot move this jelly bean to the other
pile.</em></span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The player to take the last jelly bean wins. Use strong induction to
prove that the second player always has a winning strategy in Nim-Move.
A complete and correct solution will first identify what the strategy
is, and then prove that following this strategy will lead the second
player to win the game (no matter what the first player chooses to do at
each turn).</p></li>

<hr />
<p><span><em>Sample response that can be used as reference for the

<p>Consider the statement: There is a greatest negative integer.</p>
<p>The main logical structure for this statement is that it is an
<span><strong>existential</strong></span> statement, as we can see by
translating it to symbols: <span class="math display">\[\exists g \in
\mathbb{Z}^{-} \forall x \in \mathbb{Z}^{-} ( g \geq x)\]</span> To
prove an existential statement, the main proof strategy we could use is
to find a witness. Proof by cases and proof by contradiction could also
be used, because both can be used to prove any statement (no matter its
logical structure).</p>
<p>To disprove an existential statement, we would need to prove its
negation, which (using DeMorgan’s Laws) can be written as a universal
statement. Therefore, to disprove this statement the strategies we could
use are universal generalization or structural induction (because <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}^{-}\)</span> is a recursively defined
set) or proof by cases or proof by contradiction. Notice that proof by
exhaustion is not possible because the domain is not finite.</p>
<p>The statement is true, as we can see from the witness <span
class="math inline">\(g = -1\)</span>, since it is in the domain <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}^{-}\)</span> and when we evaluate <span
class="math display">\[\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}^{-} ( -1 \geq
x)\]</span> we can proceed by universal generalization and take an
arbitrary negative integer <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, which
by definition means <span class="math inline">\(x &lt; 0\)</span>, and
since <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is an integer, guarantees
<span class="math inline">\(x \leq -1 = g\)</span>, as required.</p>

<p><span><strong>In this assignment</strong></span>, you will work with
binary relations and prove properties about them, practicing proof
strategies and applications.</p>
<p><span><strong>Relevant class material</strong></span>: Weeks
9,10.</p>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw6-proofs-cardinality-relations”.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> These homework
assignments may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students.
Please ensure your name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first
page of your homework submission, start each question on a new page, and
upload the PDF to Gradescope. If you’re working in a group,
<span><em>submit only one submission per group</em></span>: one partner
uploads the submission through their Gradescope account and then adds
the other group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting
their name(s) in the “Add Group Members” dialog box. You will need to
re-add your group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of
your assignment.</p>
<p>Each homework question will be graded either for
<span><strong>correctness</strong></span> (including clear and precise
explanations and justifications of all answers) or <span><strong>fair
effort completeness</strong></span>. You may collaborate on “graded for
correctness” questions only with CSE 20 students in your group; if your
group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours
or post a private post (visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza. For
“graded for completeness” questions: collaboration is allowed with any
CSE 20 students this quarter; if your group has questions about a
problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a public post on
Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In your proofs and disproofs of statements below, justify each step
by reference to a component of the following proof strategies we have
discussed so far, and/or to relevant definitions and calculations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A counterexample can be used to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(\forall x P(x)\)</span> is
<span><strong>false</strong></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>A witness can be used to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(\exists x P(x)\)</span> is
<span><strong>true</strong></span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of universal by exhaustion</strong></span>:
To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \, P(x)\)</span> is
true when <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> has a finite domain,
evaluate the predicate at <span><strong>each</strong></span> domain
element to confirm that it is always T.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by universal generalization</strong></span>:
To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \, P(x)\)</span> is
true, we can take an arbitrary element <span
class="math inline">\(e\)</span> from the domain and show that <span
class="math inline">\(P(e)\)</span> is true, without making any
assumptions about <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> other than that
it comes from the domain.</p></li>
<li><p>To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\exists x P(x)\)</span>
is <span><strong>false</strong></span>, write the universal statement
that is logically equivalent to its negation and then prove it true
using universal generalization.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Strategies for conjunction</strong></span>: To
prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span> is true, have
two subgoals: subgoal (1) prove <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
is true; and, subgoal (2) prove <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>
is true. To prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span> is
false, it’s enough to prove that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
is false. To prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span>
is false, it’s enough to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is false.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of Conditional by Direct
Proof</strong></span>: To prove that the implication <span
class="math inline">\(p \to q\)</span> is true, we can assume <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is true and use that assumption to show
<span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is true.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of Conditional by Contrapositive
Proof</strong></span>: To prove that the implication <span
class="math inline">\(p \to q\)</span> is true, we can assume <span
class="math inline">\(\neg q\)</span> is true and use that assumption to
show <span class="math inline">\(\neg p\)</span> is true.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by Cases</strong></span>: To prove <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> when we know <span

</ol></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Partial orders.
Recall the recursive definition of the set of linked lists of natural
numbers (from class) <span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{ll}
        \textrm{Basis Step: } &amp; [] \in L \\
        \textrm{Recursive Step: } &amp; \textrm{If } l \in L\textrm{ and
}n \in \mathbb{N} \textrm{, then } (n, l) \in L
    \end{array}\]</span> and the definition of the function which gives
the length of a linked list of natural numbers <span
class="math inline">\(length: L \to \mathbb{N}\)</span> <span
class="math display">\[\begin{array}{llll}
            \textrm{Basis Step:} &amp;  &amp; length(~[]~) &amp;= 0 \\
            \textrm{Recursive Step:} &amp; \textrm{If } l \in L\textrm{
and }n \in \mathbb{N}\textrm{, then  } &amp; length(~(n, l)~)  &amp;= 1+
length(l)
        \end{array}\]</span></p>
<p>For this question, we’ll restrict our attention to just linked lists
with data in the set <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> which
have length <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, or <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. Let’s call this restricted set of
lists <span class="math inline">\(L&#39;\)</span>.</p>
<p><span><em>Note</em></span>: <span
class="math inline">\(L&#39;\)</span> has <span
class="math inline">\(7\)</span> distinct elements.</p>
<p>Define two different partial orders with domain <span
class="math inline">\(L&#39;\)</span>. For each of the partial orders,
you can specify its definition by listing the set of ordered pairs with
roster method, giving a set builder definition, giving a recursive
definition, or using a clear and precise English description of which
lists are related to one another. Then, draw the Hasse diagram for each
of the two partial orders you defined.</p></li>
<li><p>Equivalence classes and partitions. Recall that in a movie
recommendation system, each user’s ratings of movies is represented as a
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuple (with the positive integer
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> being the number of movies in the
database), and each component of the <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuple is an element of the collection
<span class="math inline">\(\{-1,0,1\}\)</span>. Assume there are five
movies in the database, so that each user’s ratings can be represented
as a <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>-tuple. We call <span
class="math inline">\(Rt_5\)</span> the set of all ratings <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span>-tuples. Consider the binary relation on
the set of all <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>-tuples where each
component of the <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>-tuple is an
element of the collection <span
class="math inline">\(\{-1,0,1\}\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[G = \{ (u,v) \in Rt_5 \times Rt_5 \mid \text{the
number of $1$s in $u$ is the same as the number of $1$s in $v$}
\}\]</span> This is an equivalence relation (you do not need to prove
this).</p>
<p>Recall that the <span><strong>equivalence class</strong></span> of an
element <span class="math inline">\(x \in X\)</span> for an equivalence
relation <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> on the set <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the set <span
class="math inline">\(\{s \in X | (x, s) \in \sim \}\)</span>. We write

<p>In the project component of this class, you will extend your work on
assignments and explore applications of your choosing.
<span><em>Why?</em></span> To go deeper and explore the material from
discrete math and how it relates to Computer Science. You will watch
some videos and read some articles, and then connect them to our work in
CSE 20. There are two tasks in the project, and for each one you will
submit a short video and a PDF document, each addressing specific
questions.</p>
<p>As you work on the project, keep in mind our three high-level goals
for CSE 20:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Model systems with tools from discrete mathematics and reason
about implications of modelling choices. Explore applications in CS
through multiple perspectives, including software, hardware, and
theory.</p></li>
<li><p>Know, select and apply appropriate computing knowledge and
problem-solving techniques. Reason about computation and systems. Use
mathematical techniques to solve problems. Determine appropriate
conceptual tools to apply to new situations. Know when tools do not
apply and try different approaches. Critically analyze and evaluate
candidate solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly and, unambiguously communicate computational ideas using
appropriate formalism. Translate across levels of abstraction.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="what-resources-can-you-use">What resources
can you use?</h3>
<p>This project must be completed individually, without any help from
other people, including the course staff (other than logistics support
if you get stuck with screencast). You can use any of this quarter’s CSE
20 offering (notes, readings, class videos, homework feedback) and
videos and articles explicitly referenced in the project description.
These resources should be more than enough. If you are struggling to get
started and want to look elsewhere online, you must acknowledge this by
listing and citing any resources you consult (even if you do not
explicitly quote them), including any large-language model style
resources (ChatGPT, CoPilot, etc.). Link directly to them and include
the name of the author / video creator, any search strings or prompts
you used, and the reason you consulted this reference.</p>
<p>If you get stuck on any part of the project, we encourage you to
focus on communicating what you think the question might mean, including
referring to an example from class or homework you think might be
relevant, and include in your submission a discussion of any aspect
where you’re unsure. Clear communication about these theoretical ideas
and their applications is one of the main goals of the project.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="submitting-the-project">Submitting the
project</h3>
<p>You will submit a PDF plus a video file for each of the two tasks.
All file submissions will be in Gradescope. One way to record the video
is to record your screen (this is sometimes called screencast). You can
use any software you choose. One option is to record yourself with Zoom;
a tutorial on how to use Zoom to record a screencast (courtesy of Prof.
Joe Politz) is here: <a

Please send an email to the instructor (minnes@ucsd.edu) if you have
concerns about the video / screencast components of this project or
cannot complete projects in this style for some reason.</p>

<p>Your work on the project will be assigned a letter grade.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To earn at least a C on the project, most parts of the project
should be attempted and your submission should correctly demonstrate
some of the tools, techniques, and formalisms we used in class.</p></li>
<li><p>To earn at least a B on the project, almost all of the parts of
the project should be substantially complete, and a significant amount
of detail and correct notation should be used throughout your examples
and explanations.</p></li>
<li><p>To earn at least an A on the project, all of the parts of the
project should be substantially complete, with correct and appropriate
use of CSE 20 concepts and notation and clear and detailed
explanations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Since the project is also used to add +/- modifiers at the end of the
quarter, you can consider going beyond the requirements as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For example: in your PDF writeup for task 1, you could propose
several alternate modelling choices and discuss the tradeoffs
(advantages and disadvantages) between them.</p></li>
<li><p>Another exmaple: in your PDF writeup for task 2, you could
discuss what could be done to detect or correct possible errors
resulting from choices of data representations.</p></li>
<li><p>You are welcome to explore other extensions too. Keep in mind,
however, that resource limitations means we will be limited to grading
no more than 4 minutes of video and 2 pages for each task.</p></li>

<p>In machine learning, clustering can be used to group similar data for

history can be represented as a <span

about movies in the database, where <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of movies in the
database. Each element in the <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuple indicate the user’s rating of the
corresponding movie: <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> indicates
the person liked the movie, <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> that
they didn’t, and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> that they didn’t
rate it one way or another.</p>
<p>Consider the following algorithm for determining if a user’s viewing
history represents strong opinions on many movies.</p>

<p>At time 0, a particle resides at the point 0 on the real line. Within
1 second, it divides into 2 particles that fly in opposite directions
and stop at distance 1 from the original particle. Within the next
second, each of these particles again divides into 2 particles flying in
opposite directions and stopping at distance 1 from the point of
division, and so on. Whenever particles meet they annihilate (leaving
nothing behind). How many particles will there be at time <span
class="math inline">\(2^{11} -1\)</span>? You do not need to justify
your answer. Hint: Derive a formula for the number/ locations of
particles at time <span class="math inline">\(2^n-1\)</span> for
arbitrary positive integer n, prove the formula using induction, and
apply it when <span class="math inline">\(n=11\)</span>.</p>
