<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice reading and applying definitions to get comfortable
working with mathematical language.</p>
<p><span><strong>Relevant class material</strong></span>: Week 1.</p>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw1-definitions-and-notation”.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> These homework
assignments may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students.
Please ensure your name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first
page of your homework submission, start each question on a new page, and
upload the PDF to Gradescope. If you’re working in a group,
<span><em>submit only one submission per group</em></span>: one partner
uploads the submission through their Gradescope account and then adds
the other group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting
their name(s) in the “Add Group Members” dialog box. You will need to
re-add your group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of
your assignment.</p>
<p>Each homework question will be graded either for
<span><strong>correctness</strong></span> (including clear and precise
explanations and justifications of all answers) or <span><strong>fair
effort completeness</strong></span>. You may collaborate on “graded for
correctness” questions only with CSE 20 students in your group; if your
group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours
or post a private post (visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza. For
“graded for completeness” questions: collaboration is allowed with any
CSE 20 students this quarter; if your group has questions about a
problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a public post on
Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>

class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> In
class, we used <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>-tuples to
represent the user ratings for four movies. This representation is
memory-efficient because we use the order of the components in the <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span>-tuples to represent which move is being
rated. However, it is not easily extended when we want to add new movies
to the database. Define a new model that would allow us to represent the
user ratings of movie databases where we allow for new movies to be
added. Use only the data types we have talked about in class: sets,
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuples, and strings. Explain the
design choices that you used to define your model by referencing
properties of the data-type(s) you choose. Demonstrate your model by
showing how the rating of the user who dislikes Dune and Oppenheimer and

<p>(This is the same definition as in the Week 1 Review quiz.)</p>
<p>Can you find two different <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuples that represent colors that are
indistinguishable to your eye? You can use the website in the footnote
to play around with different choices of red, green, and blue levels to
see if you can distinguish between the resulting colors. Why or why
not?</p>
<p>A complete answer will include the specific example <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuples that work, along with a
description of the colors that they represent and why they are
indistinguishable, or an explanation of why there can’t be such an
example.</p></li>

Each of the sets below is described using set builder notation or
recursion or as a result of set operations applied to other known sets.
Rewrite each of the sets using the roster method.</p>
<p>Remember our discussions of data-types: use clear notation that is
consistent with our class notes and definitions to communicate the
data-types of the elements in each set.</p>

<p><span><em>Sample response that can be used as reference for the

<p>The set <span class="math inline">\(\{ \texttt{A}\} \circ \{
\texttt{A}\texttt{U}, \texttt{A}\texttt{C},
\texttt{A}\texttt{G}\}\)</span> can be written using the roster method
as <span class="math display">\[\{ \texttt{A}\texttt{A}\texttt{U},
\texttt{A}\texttt{A}\texttt{C},
\texttt{A}\texttt{A}\texttt{G}\}\]</span> because set-wise concatenation
gives a set whose elements are all possible results of concatenating an
element of the left set with an element of the right set. Since the left
set in this example only has one element, namely <span
class="math inline">\(\texttt{A}\)</span>, each of the elements of the
set we described starts with <span
class="math inline">\(\texttt{A}\)</span>. There are three elements of
this set, one for each of the distinct elements of the right set.</p>

<p>Define a <span><strong>new</strong></span> function which we’ll call
<span class="math inline">\(d_{new}\)</span> with the same domain <span
class="math inline">\(\{-1,0,1\}^4 \times \{-1,0,1\}^4\)</span> and
codomain <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> but where there
is some example pair of ratings <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span>-tuples <span class="math display">\[(~
(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4), (y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4)~)\]</span> where <span

<p>Your answer should include <span><strong>both</strong></span> a
precise and clear definition for the rule defining <span

output for each input of the function <span><strong>and</strong></span>
the example ordered pair of ratings <span

~(\texttt{A}\texttt{C}\texttt{A}\texttt{U}, \texttt{A})~)\]</span> What
is the input? What is the output? Give an example of a different choice
of input that gives the same output.</p>
<p>Your answer should include clearly labeled answers to each of the
three parts of the question, along with a justification for the values
of the applications that makes specific reference to the parts of the
recursive definition of the <span
class="math inline">\(basecount\)</span> function used to calculate
it.</p></li>

<p>The project component of this class will be an opportunity for you to
extend your work on assignments and explore applications of your
choosing.</p>
<p><span><em>Why?</em></span> To go deeper and explore the material from
discrete math and how it relates to Computer Science.</p>
<p><span><em>How?</em></span> During emergency remote instruction last
academic year, we discovered that video assessement and some open-ended
personalized projects help ensure fairness and can be less stressful for
students than in-person midterm exams. Asynchronous project submission
also gives flexibility and allows more physical distancing.</p>
<p>Your videos: We will delete all the videos we receive from you after
assigning final grades for the course, and they will be stored in a
university-controlled Google Drive directory only accessible to the
course staff during the quarter. Please send an email to the instructor
(minnes@eng.ucsd.edu) if you have concerns about the video / screencast
components of this project or cannot complete projects in this style for
some reason.</p>
<p>You may produce screencasts with any software you choose. One option
is to record yourself with Zoom; a tutorial on how to use Zoom to record
a screencast (courtesy of Prof. Joe Politz) is here:</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="what-resources-can-you-use">What resources
can you use?</h2>
<p>This project must be completed individually, without any help from
other people, including the course staff (other than logistics support
if you get stuck with screencast).</p>
<p>You can use any of this quarter’s CSE 20 offering (notes, readings,
class videos, homework feedback). These resources should be more than
enough. If you are struggling to get started and want to look elsewhere
online, you must acknowledge this by listing and citing any resources
you consult (even if you do not explicitly quote them). Link directly to
them and include the name of the author / video creator and the reason
you consulted this reference. The work you submit for the project needs
to be your own. Again, you shouldn’t need to look anywhere other than
this quarter’s material and doing so may result in definitions or
notations that conflict with our norms in this class so think carefully
before you go down this path.</p>
<p>The project has three parts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Part 1 of Project: due Thursday October 14</p></li>
<li><p>Part 2 of Project: due Thursday November 4</p></li>

<li><p>In Week 1, we discussed the mathematical definition of a
function, namely that a <span><strong>function</strong></span> is
defined by its (1) domain, (2) codomain, and (3) rule assigning each
element in the domain exactly one element in the codomain.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Write out the definition for an example function you make up. You
can choose any example you like, so long as it is your own independent
effort and it is not a function from a class example, homework, or
Review Quiz in this class so far. Use the notation defined in class.
Label and define the domain, codomain, and rule clearly.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the result of applying your function to an element in
its domain. Just like in homework, include (clear, correct, complete)
calculations and/or references to definitions to present your function
application.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>In CSE 20 this quarter, we will be exploring the applications of
discrete mathematics for core CS topics. The following videos introduce
some of these topics and the work happening here at UCSD to explore
them. Pick one of the following videos, watch it, and then write a few
sentences answering the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Which video did you watch? Why did you choose the video you
watched?</p></li>
<li><p>What followup question(s) would you like to ask the person in the
video about their work? At least one of your followup questions should
be about a technical aspect of the work that you would like to learn
more about.</p></li>

<p>Presenting your reasoning and demonstrating it via screenshare are
important skills that also show us a lot of your learning. Getting
practice with this style of presentation is a good thing for you to
learn in general and a rich way for us to assess your skills.</p>
<p>Prepare a 3-5 minute screencast video that starts with your face and
your student ID for a few seconds at the beginning, and introduce
yourself audibly while on screen. You don’t have to be on camera for the
rest of the video, though it’s fine if you are. We are looking for a
brief confirmation that it’s you creating the video and doing the work
submitted for the project.</p>
<p>Then, explain your work in question 1 of the written component.
Discuss at least one potential mistake that someone solving a similar
question should avoid (this could be a mistake you made while thinking
about this problem or something you anticipate a classmate might
struggle with); explain why the mistake is wrong and how to fix it.</p>
<p>Finally, explain any differences between your pre-survey description
of “what a function is" and the mathematical definition of what a
function is. You should have an email copy of your responses to the
pre-survey, and you can refer to what you wrote in your explanation.</p>

<li><p>In this part of the project, you will select one question from
one of the review quizzes from 10/4/2021 (Monday of Week 1) to
10/29/2021 (Friday of Week 5) to revisit. Include the problem statement,
why you picked this question (e.g. what is interesting about it, what is
hard about it, or why you wanted to take a second look at it), and your
solution.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Question selection: you can pick any <span><strong>one
question</strong></span> listed in the Review sections of the relevant
notes documents, and you must address all of its parts.</p></li>
<li><p>For each part of your chosen question: prepare a complete
solution (you can use the homework solutions we post for guidance about
the style). Your submission will be evaluated not only on the
correctness of your answers, but on your ability to present your ideas
clearly and logically. You should explain how you arrived at your
conclusions, using mathematically sound reasoning. Your goal should be
to convince the reader that your results and methods are sound. Imagine
you are preparing these solutions for someone else taking CSE 20 who
missed that week and is “catching up".</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In this part of the project, you’ll consider the importance of
data types and precision in Computer Science. Read three articles</p>
