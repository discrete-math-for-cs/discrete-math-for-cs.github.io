<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice reading and applying definitions to get comfortable
working with mathematical language.</p>
<p><span><strong>Relevant class material</strong></span>: Week 1.</p>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw1-definitions-and-notation”.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> These homework
assignments may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students.
Please ensure your name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first
page of your homework submission, start each question on a new page, and
upload the PDF to Gradescope. If you’re working in a group,
<span><em>submit only one submission per group</em></span>: one partner
uploads the submission through their Gradescope account and then adds
the other group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting
their name(s) in the “Add Group Members” dialog box. You will need to
re-add your group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of
your assignment.</p>
<p>Each homework question will be graded either for
<span><strong>correctness</strong></span> (including clear and precise
explanations and justifications of all answers) or <span><strong>fair
effort completeness</strong></span>. You may collaborate on “graded for
correctness” questions only with CSE 20 students in your group; if your
group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours
or post a private post (visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza. For
“graded for completeness” questions: collaboration is allowed with any
CSE 20 students this quarter; if your group has questions about a
problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a public post on
Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>

class, we used <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>-tuples to
represent the user ratings for four movies. This representation is
memory-efficient because we use the order of the components in the <span

rated. However, it is not easily extended when we want to add new movies
to the database. Define a new model that would allow us to represent the
user ratings of movie databases where we allow for new movies to be
added. Use only the data types we have talked about in class: sets,
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuples, and strings. Explain the
design choices that you used to define your model by referencing
properties of the data-type(s) you choose. Demonstrate your model by

<p>(This is the same definition as in the Week 1 Review quiz.)</p>
<p>Can you find two different <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuples that represent colors that are
indistinguishable to your eye? You can use the website in the footnote
to play around with different choices of red, green, and blue levels to
see if you can distinguish between the resulting colors. Why or why
not?</p>
<p>A complete answer will include the specific example <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuples that work, along with a
description of the colors that they represent and why they are
indistinguishable, or an explanation of why there can’t be such an
example.</p></li>

Each of the sets below is described using set builder notation or
recursion or as a result of set operations applied to other known sets.
Rewrite each of the sets using the roster method.</p>
<p>Remember our discussions of data-types: use clear notation that is
consistent with our class notes and definitions to communicate the
data-types of the elements in each set.</p>

<p><span><em>Sample response that can be used as reference for the

<p>The set <span class="math inline">\(\{ \texttt{A}\} \circ \{
\texttt{A}\texttt{U}, \texttt{A}\texttt{C},

as <span class="math display">\[\{ \texttt{A}\texttt{A}\texttt{U},
\texttt{A}\texttt{A}\texttt{C},
\texttt{A}\texttt{A}\texttt{G}\}\]</span> because set-wise concatenation
gives a set whose elements are all possible results of concatenating an
element of the left set with an element of the right set. Since the left
set in this example only has one element, namely <span
class="math inline">\(\texttt{A}\)</span>, each of the elements of the
set we described starts with <span
class="math inline">\(\texttt{A}\)</span>. There are three elements of
this set, one for each of the distinct elements of the right set.</p>

<p>Define a <span><strong>new</strong></span> function which we’ll call

it.</p></li>

<li><p>Multiple representations</p>
<p>Recall that, mathematically, a color can be represented as a <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuple <span class="math inline">\((r,
g, b)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> represents
the red component, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> the green
component, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> the blue component and
where each of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>
must be from the collection <span class="math inline">\(\{x \in
\mathbb{N}\mid 0 \leq x \leq 255 \}\)</span>. As an alternative
representation, in this assignment we’ll use base <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> fixed-width expansions to represent
colors as individual numbers (this definition was introduced in this
week’s Review quiz).</p>
<p><span><strong>Definition</strong></span>: A <span><strong>hex
color</strong></span> is a nonnegative integer, <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, that has a base <span
class="math inline">\(16\)</span> fixed-width <span
class="math inline">\(6\)</span> expansion <span
class="math display">\[n = (r_1r_2g_1g_2b_1b_2)_{16,6}\]</span> where
<span class="math inline">\((r_1r_2)_{16,2}\)</span> is the red
component, <span class="math inline">\((g_1g_2)_{16,2}\)</span> is the
green component, and <span
class="math inline">\((b_1b_2)_{16,2}\)</span> is the blue.</p>
<p>For this question, let’s call the set of hex colors <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span>. In the Week 2 Review quiz (Question
3d), we explored a few different set builder definitions for <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Rewrite the set
builder definition of a set below so that it refers to colors rather
than numbers: <span class="math inline">\(\{ c \in H \mid c \mod 256 =
0\}\)</span>. A complete answer will justify the new set builder
definition by connection with the definition of hex colors and how it
impacts the colors that satisfy the specific property for this
set.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Rewrite the set
builder definition of a set below so that it refers to colors rather
than numbers: <span class="math inline">\(\{ c \in H \mid c &lt;
65536\}\)</span>. A complete answer will justify the new set builder
definition by connection with the definition of hex colors and how it
impacts the colors that satisfy the specific property for this
set.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) In art, we can mix
two colors to get a new color. For example, red and blue make purple,
blue and yellow make green, red and yellow make orange. A mathematical
definition of <span><strong>hex color mixing</strong></span> would be a
function with domain <span class="math inline">\(H \times H\)</span> and
codomain <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> where the result of
applying this function to an input <span class="math inline">\((n_1,
n_2)\)</span> is the hex color that results from mixing the hex colors
<span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p><span><em>Sample work for a related question that can be used as
reference for the detail expected in your answer:</em></span> Consider
the attempted mathematical definition <span class="math inline">\(f_1:
H\times H \to H\)</span> given by <span class="math display">\[f_1
(~(n_1, n_2) ~) = n_1 + n_2\]</span> We will show that this function is
not well-defined so it cannot give a hex color mixing definition. The
reason it is not well-defined is that the application of the rule
sometimes gives values that are not in the stated codomain. To see this,
we need an example input to <span class="math inline">\(f_1\)</span> for
which the output of the rule is not in <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span>. Here is one such example: <span
class="math inline">\((n_1, n_2) = (~(FFFFFF)_{16,6},
(FFFFFF)_{16,6}~)\)</span>. This example is in <span
class="math inline">\(H \times H\)</span> because <span
class="math inline">\((FFFFFF)_{16,6}\)</span> is a nonnegative integer
that has a base <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span> fixed-width
<span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> expansion so it is a hex color.
We now apply the definition of the rule in <span
class="math inline">\(f_1\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
f_1 (~(n_1, n_2) ~) &amp;=  f_1 ( (~(FFFFFF)_{16,6}, (FFFFFF)_{16,6}~) )
= (FFFFFF)_{16,6} + (FFFFFF)_{16,6} \\
&amp;= 2 \left( 15\cdot 16^5 + 15\cdot 16^4 + 15 \cdot 16^3 + 15 \cdot
16^2 + 15 \cdot 16^1 + 15 \cdot 16^0 \right) \\
&amp;= 2 \cdot 15 \cdot (1048576 + 65536 + 4096 + 256 + 16 + 1) = 2
\cdot 15 \cdot 1118481 = 33554430
\end{aligned}\]</span> This is not a hex color because it is greater
than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(16^6 = 16777216\)</span>,
so (using the Week 2 notes on which numbers can be represented with
fixed-width expansions) it does not have a hexadecimal
<span><strong>fixed width <span
class="math inline">\(6\)</span></strong></span> expansion.</p>
<hr />
<p>In this question, we’ll look at another attempted mathematical
definition for hex color mixing. We define <span
class="math inline">\(f_2: H\times H \to H\)</span> given by <span
class="math display">\[f_2 (~(n_1, n_2) ~) = (n_1 + n_2) \textbf{ div }
2\]</span></p>
<p>This is a well-defined function. You do not need to prove this or
hand it in, but it’s good practice to make sure you understand why it’s
well-defined. Notice that the function application <span
class="math display">\[f_2 ( ~(~ (FF0000)_{16,6} , (FFFE00)_{16,6}
~)~)\]</span> can be calculated as: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
f_2&amp;(((FF0000)_{16,6}, (FFFE00)_{16,6}))=
((FF0000)_{16,6} + (FFFE00)_{16,6})) \textbf{ div } 2\\
&amp;= \big(~ \left(15\cdot16^5 + 15\cdot16^4 + 0\cdot16^3 + 0\cdot16^2
+ 0\cdot16^1 + 0\cdot16^0 \right) \\
&amp;~~~~+~
    \left((15\cdot16^5 + 15\cdot16^4 + 15\cdot16^3 + 14\cdot16^2 +
0\cdot16^1 + 0\cdot16^0\right )~\big )\textbf{ div } 2\\
&amp;= (16711680 + 16776704) \textbf{ div } 2 = 33488384 \textbf{ div }
2 = 16744192
\end{aligned}\]</span> Since this is less than <span
class="math inline">\(16^6 = 16777216\)</span>, we can represent it
using base <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span> fixed-width <span
class="math inline">\(6\)</span>:. <span
class="math display">\[(16744192)_{10} = 15\cdot16^5 + 15\cdot16^4 +
7\cdot16^3 + 15\cdot16^2 + 0\cdot16^1 + 0\cdot16^0 =
(FF7F00)_{16,6}\]</span></p>
<p>Using the web tool <a
href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp"
class="uri">https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp</a>, we can
verify that <span class="math inline">\((FF0000)_{16,6}\)</span> is red,
<span class="math inline">\((FFFE00)_{16,6}\)</span> is yellow, and
<span class="math inline">\((FF7F00)_{16,6}\)</span> is orange.</p>
<p>Show that <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> does not work as a
hex color mixing definition by finding another ordered pair of hex
colors for which the result of applying <span
class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> does not give the expected hex color.
Include the numerical description of each colors you mention, alongside
a description of them in English. Describe how you know what these
colors are (if you use a web color tool, include its URL in your
submission writeup; if not, describe your reasoning). Justify your
example with (clear, correct, complete) calculations and/or references
to definitions, and connecting them with the desired

Remember that the symbols for the inputs will be on the left-hand-side
and the symbol for the outputs <span class="math inline">\(y_0\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(y_1\)</span> will be on the right-hand

and wires to connect the inputs appropriately to give the

<li><p>Logical Equivalence. Imagine a friend suggests the following
argument to you: “The compound proposition <span
class="math display">\[(x \lor y) \land z\]</span> is logically
equivalent to <span class="math display">\[x \lor (y \land z)\]</span>
because I can transform one to the other using the following sequence of
logical equivalences: <span class="math display">\[(x \lor y) \land z
\equiv
           (x \lor (y \land y)) \land z \equiv
           x \lor ( (y \lor y) \land z) \equiv x \lor (y \land
z)\]</span> because <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is logically
equivalent to both <span class="math inline">\(y \land y\)</span> and to
<span class="math inline">\(y \lor y\)</span>".</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Prove to your
friend that they made a mistake by giving a truth assignment to the
propositional variables <span class="math inline">\(x,y,z\)</span> so
that the two compound propositions <span class="math inline">\((x \lor
y) \land z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x \lor (y \land
z)\)</span> have different truth values. Justify your choice by
evaluating these compound propositions using the definitions of the
logical connectives and include enough intermediate steps so that a
student in CSE 20 who may be struggling with the material can still
follow along with your reasoning.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Help your friend
find the problem in their argument by pointing out which step(s) were
incorrect.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Give
<span><strong>three</strong></span> different compound propositions that
are actually logically equivalent to (and not the same as) <span
class="math display">\[(x \lor y) \land z\]</span> Justify each one of
these logical equivalences either by applying a sequence of logical
equivalences or using a truth table. Notice that you can use other
logical operators (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(\lnot, \lor, \land,
\oplus, \to,
        \leftrightarrow\)</span>) when constructing your compound
propositions.</p>
<p><span><em>Bonus; not for credit (do not hand in)</em></span>: How
would you translate each of the equivalent compound propositions in
English? Does doing so help illustrate why they are equivalent?</p></li>
