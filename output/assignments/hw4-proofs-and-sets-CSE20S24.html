</header>
<p><span><strong>In this assignment</strong></span>, you will use
propositional and predicate logic to evaluate statements and arguments.
You will analyze statements and determine if they are true or false
using valid proof strategies. You will also determine if candidate
arguments are valid.</p>
<p><span><strong>Relevant class material</strong></span>: Weeks
4,5,6.</p>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw4-proofs-and-sets”.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> These homework
assignments may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students.
Please ensure your name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first
page of your homework submission, start each question on a new page, and
upload the PDF to Gradescope. If you’re working in a group,
<span><em>submit only one submission per group</em></span>: one partner
uploads the submission through their Gradescope account and then adds
the other group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting
their name(s) in the “Add Group Members” dialog box. You will need to
re-add your group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of
your assignment.</p>
<p>Each homework question will be graded either for
<span><strong>correctness</strong></span> (including clear and precise
explanations and justifications of all answers) or <span><strong>fair
effort completeness</strong></span>. You may collaborate on “graded for
correctness” questions only with CSE 20 students in your group; if your
group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours
or post a private post (visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza. For
“graded for completeness” questions: collaboration is allowed with any
CSE 20 students this quarter; if your group has questions about a
problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a public post on
Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In your proofs and disproofs of statements below, justify each step
by reference to a component of the following proof strategies we have
discussed so far, and/or to relevant definitions and calculations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A counterexample can be used to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(\forall x P(x)\)</span> is
<span><strong>false</strong></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>A witness can be used to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(\exists x P(x)\)</span> is
<span><strong>true</strong></span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of universal by exhaustion</strong></span>:
To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \, P(x)\)</span> is
true when <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> has a finite domain,
evaluate the predicate at <span><strong>each</strong></span> domain
element to confirm that it is always T.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by universal generalization</strong></span>:
To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \, P(x)\)</span> is
true, we can take an arbitrary element <span
class="math inline">\(e\)</span> from the domain and show that <span
class="math inline">\(P(e)\)</span> is true, without making any
assumptions about <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> other than that
it comes from the domain.</p></li>
<li><p>To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\exists x P(x)\)</span>
is <span><strong>false</strong></span>, write the universal statement
that is logically equivalent to its negation and then prove it true
using universal generalization.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Strategies for conjunction</strong></span>: To
prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span> is true, have
two subgoals: subgoal (1) prove <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
is true; and, subgoal (2) prove <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>
is true. To prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span> is
false, it’s enough to prove that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
is false. To prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span>
is false, it’s enough to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is false.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of Conditional by Direct
Proof</strong></span>: To prove that the implication <span
class="math inline">\(p \to q\)</span> is true, we can assume <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is true and use that assumption to show
<span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is true.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of Conditional by Contrapositive
Proof</strong></span>: To prove that the implication <span
class="math inline">\(p \to q\)</span> is true, we can assume <span
class="math inline">\(\neg q\)</span> is true and use that assumption to
show <span class="math inline">\(\neg p\)</span> is true.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by Cases</strong></span>: To prove <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> when we know <span
class="math inline">\(p_1 \lor p_2\)</span>, show that <span
class="math inline">\(p_1 \to q\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(p_2 \to q\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Evaluating predicates. Consider the following predicates, each of
which has as its domain the set of all bitstrings whose leftmost bit is
<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(E(x)\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> exactly when <span
class="math inline">\((x)_{2}\)</span> is even, and is <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> otherwise</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(L(x)\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> exactly when <span
class="math inline">\((x)_2 &lt; 15\)</span>, and is <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> otherwise</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(M(x)\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> exactly when <span
class="math inline">\((x)_2 &gt; 2\)</span> and is <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> otherwise.</p>
<hr />
<p><span><em>Sample response that can be used as reference for the
detail expected in your answer:</em></span> To prove that the statement
<span class="math display">\[\forall x ~L(x)\]</span> is false, we can
use the counterexample <span class="math inline">\(x = 1111\)</span>,
which is a bitstring whose leftmost bit is <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> (so is in the domain). Applying the
definition of <span class="math inline">\(L(x)\)</span>, since <span
class="math inline">\((1111)_2 = 1 \cdot 2^3 + 1\cdot 2^2 + 1 \cdot 2^1
+ 1 \cdot 2^0 = 8 + 4+2+1 = 15\)</span> which is not (strictly) less
than <span class="math inline">\(15\)</span>, we have that <span
class="math inline">\(L(1111) = F\)</span> and so the universal
statement is false.</p>

<p><span><em>Sample response that can be used as reference for the

below:</em></span></p>
<p>To give an example element in the set <span class="math inline">\(\{
X \in W ~|~ 1 \in X \} \cap \{ X \in W ~|~  2 \in X \}\)</span>,
consider <span class="math inline">\(\{ 1,2\}\)</span>. To prove that
this is in the set, by definition of intersection, we need to show that
<span class="math inline">\(\{1,2\} \in \{ X \in W ~|~ 1 \in X
\}\)</span> and that <span class="math inline">\(\{1,2\} \in \{ X \in W
~|~ 2 \in X \}\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>By set builder notation, elements in <span
class="math inline">\(\{ X \in W ~|~ 1 \in X \}\)</span> have to be
elements of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> which have <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> as an element. By definition of power
set, elements of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> are subsets of
<span class="math inline">\(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\)</span>. Since each element
in <span class="math inline">\(\{1,2\}\)</span> is an element of <span
class="math inline">\(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\{1,2\}\)</span> is a subset of <span
class="math inline">\(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\)</span> and hence is an element of
<span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>. Also, by roster method, <span
class="math inline">\(1 \in \{1,2\}\)</span>. Thus, <span
class="math inline">\(\{1,2\}\)</span> satisfies the conditions for
membership in <span class="math inline">\(\{ X \in W ~|~ 1 \in X
\}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, by set builder notation, elements in <span
class="math inline">\(\{ X \in W ~|~ 2 \in X \}\)</span> have to be
elements of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> which have <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> as an element. By definition of power
set, elements of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> are subsets of
<span class="math inline">\(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\)</span>. Since each element
in <span class="math inline">\(\{1,2\}\)</span> is an element of <span
class="math inline">\(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\{1,2\}\)</span> is a subset of <span
class="math inline">\(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\)</span> and hence is an element of
<span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>. Also, by roster method, <span
class="math inline">\(2 \in \{1,2\}\)</span>. Thus, <span
class="math inline">\(\{1,2\}\)</span> satisfies the conditions for
membership in <span class="math inline">\(\{ X \in W ~|~ 2 \in X

<p>Demonstrate that this attempted proof is invalid by providing and
justifying a <span><strong>counterexample</strong></span> (disproving

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) A Venn diagram is
a chart of overlapping regions that illustrates the similarities
differences of a collection of sets. You may have seen some examples in
memes, including these (from a web search):</p>
<div class="center">

</div>
<p>Mostly we see Venn Diagrams with 2 or 3 circles (or other shapes). In
this question, we consider how to draw a Venn Diagram with 4
regions.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Here is a Venn Diagram with 2 circles. Each region is labelled
(encoded) with a binary string with 2 bits. Notice that there are four
regions: the region outside of the two circles, the region inside the
left circle and not the right circle, the region inside the right circle
and not the left circle, and the region inside both circles.</p>
<div class="center">
<p><img src="../../resources/images/VennDiagram2Circles.png"
style="width:1.5in" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>Generalize this encoding by encoding each region in this 3 circle
Venn Diagram with a unique binary string with 3 bits.</p>
<div class="center">
<p><img src="../../resources/images/VennDiagram3Circles.png"
style="width:1.5in" alt="image" /></p>
</div></li>
<li><p>Give an alternate representation of the regions in the 2 circle
and 3 circle Venn Diagrams by labelling each circle with a letter (<span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, or <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, for example) and then expressing each
region as the result of combining these with set operations (like union,
intersection, and set difference).</p></li>
<li><p>Here are two attempts at a Venn Diagram with 4 shapes, one with
circles and the other with ellipses.</p>

</div>
<p>Is there anything missing from either diagram? (How many regions are
there? How many regions should there be in order to use each 4 bit
binary string exactly once in a generalization of the encoding we saw
before?) If you had to choose one of these diagrams, which would you
choose, and why?</p></li>

<p>By universal generalization, <span><strong>choose</strong></span>

<span class="math inline">\(F(~(1,e)~)\)</span>. By definition of the

goal as <span class="math inline">\(\exists c \in \mathbb{Z}~(e = c
\cdot 1)\)</span>. We pick the <span><strong>witness</strong></span>
<span class="math inline">\(c = e\)</span>, which is an integer and
therefore in the domain. Calculating, <span class="math inline">\(c
\cdot 1 = e \cdot 1 = e\)</span>, as required. Since the predicate <span

by the following proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To disprove the statement, we need to find a counterexample. We
choose <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, a nonzero integer so in
the domain. We need to show that <span class="math inline">\(\lnot
F(~(2,1)~)\)</span>. By definition of the predicate <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, we can rewrite this goal as <span
class="math inline">\(1 \textbf{ mod } 2 \neq 0\)</span>. By definition
of integer division, since <span class="math inline">\(1 = 0 \cdot 2  +
1\)</span> (and <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq 1 &lt; 2\)</span>),
<span class="math inline">\(1 \textbf { mod } 2 = 1\)</span> which is
nonzero so the counterexample works to disprove the original statement.
<span class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></p>
