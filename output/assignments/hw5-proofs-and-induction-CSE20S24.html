<p><span><strong>In this assignment</strong></span>, you will work with
recursively defined sets and functions and prove properties about them,
practicing induction and other proof strategies.</p>
<p><span><strong>Relevant class material</strong></span>: Weeks
5,6,7.</p>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw5-proofs-and-induction”.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> These homework
assignments may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students.
Please ensure your name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first
page of your homework submission, start each question on a new page, and
upload the PDF to Gradescope. If you’re working in a group,
<span><em>submit only one submission per group</em></span>: one partner
uploads the submission through their Gradescope account and then adds
the other group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting
their name(s) in the “Add Group Members” dialog box. You will need to
re-add your group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of
your assignment.</p>
<p>Each homework question will be graded either for
<span><strong>correctness</strong></span> (including clear and precise
explanations and justifications of all answers) or <span><strong>fair
effort completeness</strong></span>. You may collaborate on “graded for
correctness” questions only with CSE 20 students in your group; if your
group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours
or post a private post (visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza. For
“graded for completeness” questions: collaboration is allowed with any
CSE 20 students this quarter; if your group has questions about a
problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a public post on
Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In your proofs and disproofs of statements below, justify each step
by reference to a component of the following proof strategies we have
discussed so far, and/or to relevant definitions and calculations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A counterexample can be used to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(\forall x P(x)\)</span> is
<span><strong>false</strong></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>A witness can be used to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(\exists x P(x)\)</span> is
<span><strong>true</strong></span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of universal by exhaustion</strong></span>:
To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \, P(x)\)</span> is
true when <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> has a finite domain,
evaluate the predicate at <span><strong>each</strong></span> domain
element to confirm that it is always T.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by universal generalization</strong></span>:
To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \, P(x)\)</span> is
true, we can take an arbitrary element <span
class="math inline">\(e\)</span> from the domain and show that <span
class="math inline">\(P(e)\)</span> is true, without making any
assumptions about <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> other than that
it comes from the domain.</p></li>
<li><p>To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\exists x P(x)\)</span>
is <span><strong>false</strong></span>, write the universal statement
that is logically equivalent to its negation and then prove it true
using universal generalization.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Strategies for conjunction</strong></span>: To
prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span> is true, have
two subgoals: subgoal (1) prove <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
is true; and, subgoal (2) prove <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>
is true. To prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span> is
false, it’s enough to prove that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
is false. To prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span>
is false, it’s enough to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is false.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of Conditional by Direct
Proof</strong></span>: To prove that the implication <span
class="math inline">\(p \to q\)</span> is true, we can assume <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is true and use that assumption to show
<span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is true.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of Conditional by Contrapositive
Proof</strong></span>: To prove that the implication <span
class="math inline">\(p \to q\)</span> is true, we can assume <span
class="math inline">\(\neg q\)</span> is true and use that assumption to
show <span class="math inline">\(\neg p\)</span> is true.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by Cases</strong></span>: To prove <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> when we know <span
class="math inline">\(p_1 \lor p_2\)</span>, show that <span
class="math inline">\(p_1 \to q\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(p_2 \to q\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by Structural Induction</strong></span>: To
prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \in X \, P(x)\)</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a recursively defined
set, prove two cases:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Basis Step:</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Show the statement holds for elements
specified in the basis step of the definition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Recursive Step:</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Show that if the statement is true for
each of the elements used to construct new elements in the recursive
step of the definition, the result holds for these new elements.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by Mathematical Induction</strong></span>: To
prove a universal quantification over the set of all integers greater
than or equal to some base integer <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>:</p>

class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, and use this and other facts to prove
that the property holds for <span
class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by Strong Induction</strong></span> To prove
that a universal quantification over the set of all integers greater
than or equal to some base integer <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> holds, pick a fixed nonnegative integer
<span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and then:</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Consider an arbitrary integer <span

class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by Contradiction</strong></span></p>
<p>To prove that a statement <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is
true, pick another statement <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and
once we show that <span class="math inline">\(\neg p  \to (r
\wedge  \neg r)\)</span> then we can conclude that <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is true.</p>

<li><p>Statement: “the sum of the first <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> positive odd integers is <span
class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span>"</p>
<p><span><strong>Attempted Proof:</strong> </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Base Case: <span class="math inline">\(n = 1\)</span><br />
First odd number is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>; <span
class="math inline">\(1^2 = 1\)</span>. True.<br />
<span class="math inline">\((n + 1)^2 = n^2 + 2n + 1\)</span><br />
<span class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span> is the sum of the first <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> odd numbers, and <span
class="math inline">\(2n + 1\)</span> is the next odd number in the
sequence, therefore <span class="math inline">\((n + 1)^2 =\)</span> the
sum of the first <span class="math inline">\(n + 1\)</span> odd
numbers.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Statement: “For every nonnegative integer <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(3 |
n\)</span>." (Recall that the <span class="math inline">\(\mid\)</span>
symbol is used to mean “divides” or “is a factor of”.)</p>
<p><span><strong>Attempted Proof:</strong> </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Attempted Proof: We proceed by strong mathematical induction.</p>
<p><span><em>Basis step:</em></span> Indeed, <span
class="math inline">\(3 | 0\)</span> because there is an integer, namely
<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(0 = 3\cdot 0\)</span>.</p>
<p><span><em>Induction step:</em></span> Let <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> be arbitrary. Assume, as the strong
induction hypothesis, that for all nonnegative integers <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq
j \leq k\)</span>, that <span class="math inline">\(3 | j\)</span>.
Write <span class="math inline">\(k+1 = m + n\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(m,n\)</span> are integers less than <span
class="math inline">\(k+1\)</span>. By the induction hypothesis, <span
class="math inline">\(3 | m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(3 |
n\)</span>. That is, there are integers <span
class="math inline">\(a,b\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(m = 3a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n=3b\)</span>. Therefore, <span
class="math inline">\(k+1 = (3a) + (3b) = 3 (a+b)\)</span>. We can
choose <span class="math inline">\(a + b\)</span>, where we know <span
class="math inline">\(a + b \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>, to show that <span
class="math inline">\(3 | (k+1)\)</span>, as required.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Decide whether
each statement above is true or false, give correct and complete
induction proofs for the true statement(s) and disprove by
counterexample for the false statement(s).</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Games and
induction. The game of Nim-Var is a two-player game (which is a variant
of Nim). At the start of the game, there are two piles, each containing
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> jelly beans (<span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is a positive integer). On a player’s
turn, that player picks one of the two piles and does
<span><strong>one</strong></span> of the following: either</p>
<ul>
<li><p>removes some positive number of jelly beans from that pile,
<span><strong>or</strong></span></p></li>
<li><p>moves some positive number of jelly beans (that is less than the
current total number of jelly beans in the pile) from that pile to the
other. <span><em>Note: if there is only one jelly bean left in a pile,
the player cannot move this jelly bean to the other
pile.</em></span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The player to take the last jelly bean wins. Use strong induction to
prove that the second player always has a winning strategy in Nim-Move.
A complete and correct solution will first identify what the strategy
is, and then prove that following this strategy will lead the second
player to win the game (no matter what the first player chooses to do at
each turn).</p></li>
<li><p>Linked Lists. Recall the recursive definition of the set of
linked lists of natural numbers (from class) <span
class="math display">\[\begin{array}{ll}
        \textrm{Basis Step: } &amp; [] \in L \\
        \textrm{Recursive Step: } &amp; \textrm{If } l \in L\textrm{ and
}n \in \mathbb{N} \textrm{, then } (n, l) \in L
    \end{array}\]</span> and the definitions of the function which gives
the length of a linked list of natural numbers <span
class="math inline">\(length: L \to \mathbb{N}\)</span> <span
class="math display">\[\begin{array}{llll}

and }n \in \mathbb{N}\textrm{, then  } &amp; length(~(n, l)~)  &amp;= 1+
length(l)
        \end{array}\]</span> the function <span
class="math inline">\(append : L \times \mathbb{N} \to L\)</span> that
adds an element at the end of a linked list <span
class="math display">\[\begin{array}{llll}

then } &amp; append(~([], m)~) &amp; = (m, [])\\
        \textrm{Recursive Step:} &amp; \textrm{If } l \in L\textrm{ and
}n \in \mathbb{N}\textrm{ and }m \in \mathbb{N}\textrm{, then  } &amp;
append(~(~(n, l), m~)~)  &amp;= (n, append(~(l, m)~)~)
        \end{array}\]</span> and the function <span
class="math inline">\(prepend : L \times \mathbb{N} \to L\)</span> that
adds an element at the front of a linked list <span
class="math display">\[prepend(~(l, n)~) = (n, l)\]</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span><em>Sample response that can be used as reference for the
detail expected in your answer:</em></span> To evaluate the result of
<span class="math inline">\(length(~(4,(2,(7,[])))~)\)</span> we
calculate: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        length(~(4,(2,(7,[])))~) &amp;= 1 + length ( ~(2,(7,[]))~) \\

<p>In this question, we’ll consider the combination of these functions
with a new function, one that removes the element at the front of the
list (if there is any). We define <span class="math inline">\(remove: L
\to L\)</span> by <span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{ll}
            \textrm{Basis Step: } &amp; remove([]) = [] \\
            \textrm{Recursive Step: } &amp; \textrm{If } l \in L\textrm{
and }n \in \mathbb{N} \textrm{, then } remove(~(n, l)~) = l
        \end{array}\]</span></p>

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) What is the result

<li><p>Primes, divisors, and proof strategies. For each statement below,
identify the <span><strong>main logical structure or
connective</strong></span> of the statement, list the proof strategies
that could be used to prove and to disprove a statement with that
structure, then identify whether the statement is true or false and
justify with a proof of the statement or its negation. (<span><em>Graded

<p><span><em>Sample response that can be used as reference for the
detail expected in your answer:</em></span></p>
<p>Consider the statement: There is a greatest negative integer.</p>
<p>The main logical structure for this statement is that it is an
<span><strong>existential</strong></span> statement, as we can see by
translating it to symbols: <span class="math display">\[\exists g \in
\mathbb{Z}^{-} \forall x \in \mathbb{Z}^{-} ( g \geq x)\]</span> To
prove an existential statement, the main proof strategy we could use is
to find a witness. Proof by cases and proof by contradiction could also
be used, because both can be used to prove any statement (no matter its
logical structure).</p>
<p>To disprove an existential statement, we would need to prove its
negation, which (using DeMorgan’s Laws) can be written as a universal
statement. Therefore, to disprove this statement the strategies we could
use are universal generalization or structural induction (because <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}^{-}\)</span> is a recursively defined
set) or proof by cases or proof by contradiction. Notice that proof by
exhaustion is not possible because the domain is not finite.</p>
<p>The statement is true, as we can see from the witness <span
class="math inline">\(g = -1\)</span>, since it is in the domain <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}^{-}\)</span> and when we evaluate <span
class="math display">\[\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}^{-} ( -1 \geq
x)\]</span> we can proceed by universal generalization and take an
arbitrary negative integer <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, which
by definition means <span class="math inline">\(x &lt; 0\)</span>, and
since <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is an integer, guarantees
<span class="math inline">\(x \leq -1 = g\)</span>, as required.</p>
