<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice reading and applying definitions to get comfortable
working with mathematical language.</p>
<p><span><strong>Relevant class material</strong></span>: Week 1.</p>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw1-definitions-and-notation”.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> These homework
assignments may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students.
Please ensure your name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first
page of your homework submission, start each question on a new page, and
upload the PDF to Gradescope. If you’re working in a group,
<span><em>submit only one submission per group</em></span>: one partner
uploads the submission through their Gradescope account and then adds
the other group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting
their name(s) in the “Add Group Members” dialog box. You will need to
re-add your group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of
your assignment.</p>
<p>Each homework question will be graded either for
<span><strong>correctness</strong></span> (including clear and precise
explanations and justifications of all answers) or <span><strong>fair
effort completeness</strong></span>. You may collaborate on “graded for
correctness” questions only with CSE 20 students in your group; if your
group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours
or post a private post (visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza. For
“graded for completeness” questions: collaboration is allowed with any
CSE 20 students this quarter; if your group has questions about a
problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a public post on
Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>

class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> In
class, we used <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>-tuples to
represent the user ratings for four movies. This representation is
memory-efficient because we use the order of the components in the <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span>-tuples to represent which move is being
rated. However, it is not easily extended when we want to add new movies
to the database. Define a new model that would allow us to represent the
user ratings of movie databases where we allow for new movies to be
added. Use only the data types we have talked about in class: sets,
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuples, and strings. Explain the
design choices that you used to define your model by referencing
properties of the data-type(s) you choose. Demonstrate your model by
showing how the rating of the user who dislikes Dune and Oppenheimer and
likes Barbie and Nimona is represented.</p></li>

<p>(This is the same definition as in the Week 1 Review quiz.)</p>
<p>Can you find two different <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuples that represent colors that are
indistinguishable to your eye? You can use the website in the footnote
to play around with different choices of red, green, and blue levels to
see if you can distinguish between the resulting colors. Why or why
not?</p>
<p>A complete answer will include the specific example <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuples that work, along with a
description of the colors that they represent and why they are
indistinguishable, or an explanation of why there can’t be such an
example.</p></li>

Each of the sets below is described using set builder notation or
recursion or as a result of set operations applied to other known sets.
Rewrite each of the sets using the roster method.</p>
<p>Remember our discussions of data-types: use clear notation that is
consistent with our class notes and definitions to communicate the
data-types of the elements in each set.</p>
<hr />
<p><span><em>Sample response that can be used as reference for the
detail expected in your answer:</em></span></p>
<p>The set <span class="math inline">\(\{ \texttt{A}\} \circ \{
\texttt{A}\texttt{U}, \texttt{A}\texttt{C},
\texttt{A}\texttt{G}\}\)</span> can be written using the roster method
as <span class="math display">\[\{ \texttt{A}\texttt{A}\texttt{U},
\texttt{A}\texttt{A}\texttt{C},
\texttt{A}\texttt{A}\texttt{G}\}\]</span> because set-wise concatenation
gives a set whose elements are all possible results of concatenating an
element of the left set with an element of the right set. Since the left
set in this example only has one element, namely <span
class="math inline">\(\texttt{A}\)</span>, each of the elements of the
set we described starts with <span
class="math inline">\(\texttt{A}\)</span>. There are three elements of
this set, one for each of the distinct elements of the right set.</p>

<li><p>The set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> defined
recursively as <span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{ll}

<li><p><span class="math display">\[\{ x \in S \mid rnalen(x) = 2 \}
\circ \{x \in S \mid rnalen(x) = 0 \}\]</span> where <span

</ol></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Recall the

class="math display">\[d_0 (~(~ (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4), (y_1, y_2, y_3,
y_4) ~) ~) = \sqrt{ (x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2 + (x_3 -y_3)^2 + (x_4
-y_4)^2}\]</span></p>
<p>Define a <span><strong>new</strong></span> function which we’ll call
<span class="math inline">\(d_{new}\)</span> with the same domain <span
class="math inline">\(\{-1,0,1\}^4 \times \{-1,0,1\}^4\)</span> and
codomain <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> but where there
is some example pair of ratings <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span>-tuples <span class="math display">\[(~
(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4), (y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4)~)\]</span> where <span

<p>Your answer should include <span><strong>both</strong></span> a
precise and clear definition for the rule defining <span

output for each input of the function <span><strong>and</strong></span>
the example ordered pair of ratings <span

functions are not equal. Also include a justification of your answers
with (clear, correct, complete) calculations for each of the function
applications and/or references to definitions and connecting them with
the desired conclusion.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) A function
<em>basecount</em> that computes the number of a given base <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> appearing in a RNA strand <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is defined recursively:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{llll}

        \end{cases} &amp;
\end{array}\]</span> Consider the function application <span
class="math display">\[basecount(
~(\texttt{A}\texttt{C}\texttt{A}\texttt{U}, \texttt{A})~)\]</span> What
is the input? What is the output? Give an example of a different choice
of input that gives the same output.</p>
<p>Your answer should include clearly labeled answers to each of the
three parts of the question, along with a justification for the values
of the applications that makes specific reference to the parts of the
recursive definition of the <span
class="math inline">\(basecount\)</span> function used to calculate
it.</p></li>
