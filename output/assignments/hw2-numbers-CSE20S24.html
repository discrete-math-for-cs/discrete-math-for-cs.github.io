<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice applying functions and tracing algorithms in
multiple contexts, and exploring properties of positional number
representations.</p>
<p><span><strong>Relevant class material</strong></span>: Week 2.</p>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw2-numbers”.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> These homework
assignments may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students.
Please ensure your name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first
page of your homework submission, start each question on a new page, and
upload the PDF to Gradescope. If you’re working in a group,
<span><em>submit only one submission per group</em></span>: one partner
uploads the submission through their Gradescope account and then adds
the other group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting
their name(s) in the “Add Group Members” dialog box. You will need to
re-add your group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of
your assignment.</p>
<p>Each homework question will be graded either for
<span><strong>correctness</strong></span> (including clear and precise
explanations and justifications of all answers) or <span><strong>fair
effort completeness</strong></span>. You may collaborate on “graded for
correctness” questions only with CSE 20 students in your group; if your
group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours
or post a private post (visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza. For
“graded for completeness” questions: collaboration is allowed with any
CSE 20 students this quarter; if your group has questions about a
problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a public post on
Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Functions and algorithms: in this question you’ll explore the
properties of the (integer) power and logarithm functions. We’ll use
some definitions we introduced in class this week, namely the function
<span class="math inline">\(b^i\)</span> with domain <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}^+ \times \mathbb{N}\)</span> and
codomain <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> defined
recursively by <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
&amp;\textrm{Basis Step:} \\
&amp;b^0 = 1 \\
&amp;\textrm{Recursive Step:}\\
&amp;\textrm{If } i \in \mathbb{N}, b^{i+1} = b \cdot b^i
\end{aligned}\]</span> and the algorithm:</p>
<div class="algorithm">
<p>procedure <span class="math inline">\(logb\)</span>(<span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>,<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>:
positive integers with <span class="math inline">\(b &gt; 1\)</span>)
<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> := <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> while <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> &gt; <span
class="math inline">\(b-1\)</span> <span

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) <a href="#fn1"

Choose a positive integer <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> between

</ol></li>
<li><p>Base expansions</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Pick an integer
between <span class="math inline">\(50\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(1000\)</span> (inclusive) that you (or one of your

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) What patterns do
you notice in your calculations in part (d)?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Multiple representations</p>
<p>Recall that, mathematically, a color can be represented as a <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuple <span class="math inline">\((r,
g, b)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> represents
the red component, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> the green
component, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> the blue component and
where each of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>
must be from the collection <span class="math inline">\(\{x \in
\mathbb{N}\mid 0 \leq x \leq 255 \}\)</span>. As an alternative
representation, in this assignment we’ll use base <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> fixed-width expansions to represent
colors as individual numbers (this definition was introduced in this
week’s Review quiz).</p>
<p><span><strong>Definition</strong></span>: A <span><strong>hex
color</strong></span> is a nonnegative integer, <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, that has a base <span
class="math inline">\(16\)</span> fixed-width <span
class="math inline">\(6\)</span> expansion <span
class="math display">\[n = (r_1r_2g_1g_2b_1b_2)_{16,6}\]</span> where
<span class="math inline">\((r_1r_2)_{16,2}\)</span> is the red
component, <span class="math inline">\((g_1g_2)_{16,2}\)</span> is the
green component, and <span
class="math inline">\((b_1b_2)_{16,2}\)</span> is the blue.</p>
<p>For this question, let’s call the set of hex colors <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span>. In the Week 2 Review quiz (Question
3d), we explored a few different set builder definitions for <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Rewrite the set
builder definition of a set below so that it refers to colors rather
than numbers: <span class="math inline">\(\{ c \in H \mid c \mod 256 =
0\}\)</span>. A complete answer will justify the new set builder
definition by connection with the definition of hex colors and how it
impacts the colors that satisfy the specific property for this
set.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Rewrite the set
builder definition of a set below so that it refers to colors rather
than numbers: <span class="math inline">\(\{ c \in H \mid c &lt;
65536\}\)</span>. A complete answer will justify the new set builder
definition by connection with the definition of hex colors and how it
impacts the colors that satisfy the specific property for this
set.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) In art, we can mix
two colors to get a new color. For example, red and blue make purple,
blue and yellow make green, red and yellow make orange. A mathematical
definition of <span><strong>hex color mixing</strong></span> would be a
function with domain <span class="math inline">\(H \times H\)</span> and
codomain <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> where the result of
applying this function to an input <span class="math inline">\((n_1,
n_2)\)</span> is the hex color that results from mixing the hex colors
<span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p><span><em>Sample work for a related question that can be used as
reference for the detail expected in your answer:</em></span> Consider
the attempted mathematical definition <span class="math inline">\(f_1:
H\times H \to H\)</span> given by <span class="math display">\[f_1
(~(n_1, n_2) ~) = n_1 + n_2\]</span> We will show that this function is
not well-defined so it cannot give a hex color mixing definition. The
reason it is not well-defined is that the application of the rule
sometimes gives values that are not in the stated codomain. To see this,
we need an example input to <span class="math inline">\(f_1\)</span> for
which the output of the rule is not in <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span>. Here is one such example: <span
class="math inline">\((n_1, n_2) = (~(FFFFFF)_{16,6},
(FFFFFF)_{16,6}~)\)</span>. This example is in <span
class="math inline">\(H \times H\)</span> because <span
class="math inline">\((FFFFFF)_{16,6}\)</span> is a nonnegative integer
that has a base <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span> fixed-width
<span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> expansion so it is a hex color.
We now apply the definition of the rule in <span
class="math inline">\(f_1\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
f_1 (~(n_1, n_2) ~) &amp;=  f_1 ( (~(FFFFFF)_{16,6}, (FFFFFF)_{16,6}~) )
= (FFFFFF)_{16,6} + (FFFFFF)_{16,6} \\
&amp;= 2 \left( 15\cdot 16^5 + 15\cdot 16^4 + 15 \cdot 16^3 + 15 \cdot
16^2 + 15 \cdot 16^1 + 15 \cdot 16^0 \right) \\
&amp;= 2 \cdot 15 \cdot (1048576 + 65536 + 4096 + 256 + 16 + 1) = 2
\cdot 15 \cdot 1118481 = 33554430
\end{aligned}\]</span> This is not a hex color because it is greater
than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(16^6 = 16777216\)</span>,
so (using the Week 2 notes on which numbers can be represented with
fixed-width expansions) it does not have a hexadecimal
<span><strong>fixed width <span
class="math inline">\(6\)</span></strong></span> expansion.</p>
<hr />
<p>In this question, we’ll look at another attempted mathematical
definition for hex color mixing. We define <span
class="math inline">\(f_2: H\times H \to H\)</span> given by <span
class="math display">\[f_2 (~(n_1, n_2) ~) = (n_1 + n_2) \textbf{ div }
2\]</span></p>
<p>This is a well-defined function. You do not need to prove this or
hand it in, but it’s good practice to make sure you understand why it’s
well-defined. Notice that the function application <span
class="math display">\[f_2 ( ~(~ (FF0000)_{16,6} , (FFFE00)_{16,6}
~)~)\]</span> can be calculated as: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
f_2&amp;(((FF0000)_{16,6}, (FFFE00)_{16,6}))=
((FF0000)_{16,6} + (FFFE00)_{16,6})) \textbf{ div } 2\\
&amp;= \big(~ \left(15\cdot16^5 + 15\cdot16^4 + 0\cdot16^3 + 0\cdot16^2
+ 0\cdot16^1 + 0\cdot16^0 \right) \\
&amp;~~~~+~
    \left((15\cdot16^5 + 15\cdot16^4 + 15\cdot16^3 + 14\cdot16^2 +
0\cdot16^1 + 0\cdot16^0\right )~\big )\textbf{ div } 2\\
&amp;= (16711680 + 16776704) \textbf{ div } 2 = 33488384 \textbf{ div }
2 = 16744192
\end{aligned}\]</span> Since this is less than <span
class="math inline">\(16^6 = 16777216\)</span>, we can represent it
using base <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span> fixed-width <span
class="math inline">\(6\)</span>:. <span
class="math display">\[(16744192)_{10} = 15\cdot16^5 + 15\cdot16^4 +
7\cdot16^3 + 15\cdot16^2 + 0\cdot16^1 + 0\cdot16^0 =
(FF7F00)_{16,6}\]</span></p>
<p>Using the web tool <a
href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp"
class="uri">https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp</a>, we can
verify that <span class="math inline">\((FF0000)_{16,6}\)</span> is red,
<span class="math inline">\((FFFE00)_{16,6}\)</span> is yellow, and
<span class="math inline">\((FF7F00)_{16,6}\)</span> is orange.</p>
<p>Show that <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> does not work as a
hex color mixing definition by finding another ordered pair of hex
colors for which the result of applying <span
class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> does not give the expected hex color.
Include the numerical description of each colors you mention, alongside
a description of them in English. Describe how you know what these
colors are (if you use a web color tool, include its URL in your
submission writeup; if not, describe your reasoning). Justify your
example with (clear, correct, complete) calculations and/or references
to definitions, and connecting them with the desired

the correctness of your answers, but on your ability to present your
ideas clearly and logically. You should explain how you arrived at your

formal proof techniques or write a more informal argument for why
something is true, your answers should always be well-supported. Your
goal should be to convince the reader that your results and methods are
sound.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn2"><p>This means you will get full credit so long as your
submission demonstrates honest effort to answer the question. You will
not be penalized for incorrect answers. To demonstrate your honest
effort in answering the question, we expect you to include your attempt
to answer *each* part of the question. If you get stuck with your
attempt, you can still demonstrate your effort by explaining where you
got stuck and what you did to try to get unstuck.<a href="#fnref2"
