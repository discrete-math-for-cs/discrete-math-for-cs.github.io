<h1 class="title">Project</h1>
<p class="author">CSE20S24</p>
<p class="date">Due: 5/8/24 at 5pm (late submission until 8am next
morning) - Extended by 24 hours</p>
</header>
<p>In the project component of this class, you will extend your work on
assignments and explore applications of your choosing.
<span><em>Why?</em></span> To go deeper and explore the material from
discrete math and how it relates to Computer Science. You will watch
some videos and read some articles, and then connect them to our work in
CSE 20. There are two tasks in the project, and for each one you will
submit a short video and a PDF document, each addressing specific
questions.</p>
<p>As you work on the project, keep in mind our three high-level goals
for CSE 20:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Model systems with tools from discrete mathematics and reason
about implications of modelling choices. Explore applications in CS
through multiple perspectives, including software, hardware, and
theory.</p></li>
<li><p>Know, select and apply appropriate computing knowledge and
problem-solving techniques. Reason about computation and systems. Use
mathematical techniques to solve problems. Determine appropriate
conceptual tools to apply to new situations. Know when tools do not
apply and try different approaches. Critically analyze and evaluate
candidate solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly and, unambiguously communicate computational ideas using
appropriate formalism. Translate across levels of abstraction.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="what-resources-can-you-use">What resources
can you use?</h3>
<p>This project must be completed individually, without any help from
other people, including the course staff (other than logistics support
if you get stuck with screencast). You can use any of this quarter’s CSE
20 offering (notes, readings, class videos, homework feedback) and
videos and articles explicitly referenced in the project description.
These resources should be more than enough. If you are struggling to get
started and want to look elsewhere online, you must acknowledge this by
listing and citing any resources you consult (even if you do not
explicitly quote them), including any large-language model style
resources (ChatGPT, CoPilot, etc.). Link directly to them and include
the name of the author / video creator, any search strings or prompts
you used, and the reason you consulted this reference.</p>
<p>If you get stuck on any part of the project, we encourage you to
focus on communicating what you think the question might mean, including
referring to an example from class or homework you think might be
relevant, and include in your submission a discussion of any aspect
where you’re unsure. Clear communication about these theoretical ideas
and their applications is one of the main goals of the project.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="submitting-the-project">Submitting the
project</h3>
<p>You will submit a PDF plus a video file for each of the two tasks.
All file submissions will be in Gradescope. One way to record the video
is to record your screen (this is sometimes called screencast). You can
use any software you choose. One option is to record yourself with Zoom;
a tutorial on how to use Zoom to record a screencast (courtesy of Prof.
Joe Politz) is here: <a
href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KROMAQuTCk40zwrEFotlYSJJQdcG_GUU"
class="uri">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KROMAQuTCk40zwrEFotlYSJJQdcG_GUU</a>.
The video that was produced from that recording session in Zoom is here:
<a

class="uri">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MxJN6CQcXqIbOekDYMxjh7mTt1TyRVMl</a>
Please send an email to the instructor (minnes@ucsd.edu) if you have
concerns about the video / screencast components of this project or
cannot complete projects in this style for some reason.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="task-1-exploring-an-application">Task 1:
Exploring an application</h3>
<p>In CSE 20 this quarter, we will be exploring the applications of
discrete mathematics for core Computer Science and Engineering topics.
<span><strong>Pick one</strong></span> of the following videos about
work done here at UC San Diego (or by people associated with UC San
Diego) and complete both steps of the task described below.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Watch the video from above that you selected.
<span><strong>Record a new video</strong></span> where you present your
answers to the following three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Which video did you watch?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did you choose the video you watched?</p></li>
<li><p>What are three kinds of data or information that are related to
the project described in the video?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Your video for this task should be 1-3 minutes. Start with your face
and your student ID visible for a few seconds at the beginning, and
introduce yourself audibly while on screen. You don’t have to be on
camera for the rest of the video, though it’s fine if you are. We are
looking for a brief confirmation that it’s you creating the video and
doing the work submitted for the project. When you are explaining the
three kinds of data or information (third part of question 1), we
recommend you show them in the video in some form.</p></li>
<li><p>In the document part of this task, you will explore how to use
CSE 20 techniques to model each of the three kinds of data or
information that you identified in your video. In particular, answer the
following questions in a document that you will submit to
Gradescope:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Describe how each of the three kinds of data or information can
be modelled using the data types that we discussed in class (sets,
ordered <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuples, strings, or
functions). Explain why you are choosing to model this data or
information with this data type: what are the benefits and what are the
limitations of this model?</p></li>
<li><p>Write a set using roster method or set builder notation or
recursive description that has at least three elements and that
demonstrates your model. Include a description of the data or
information in English and also include how it is represented in your
model.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Type out your answers</strong></span> to these
questions for all of the three kinds of data you identified, how you
could model each one, and example sets, and upload your PDF to
Gradescope.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="task-2-errors-and-multiple-representations">Task 2: Errors and
multiple representations</h3>
<p>Sometimes, the way we represent data leads to imprecision or outright
mistakes. Watch the video and read the articles below and then complete
the task described.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><span><strong>Record a video</strong></span> where you discuss
your answers to these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What are examples in the video or articles above where computers
or Computer Science were used to help *avoid* an error?</p></li>
<li><p>Give an example where *you* used computers or Computer Science to
help you *avoid* an error?</p></li>
<li><p>What are examples in the video or articles above where the use of
computers or Computer Science *caused* an error.</p></li>
<li><p>Give an example where *your* use of computers or Computer Science
*caused* an error.</p></li>
<li><p>What do you do to increase your confidence in the results of your
own human and digital (i.e. machine) computation? Why do you think these
are sufficient?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Focus on your communication clarity in the video for this task.
Imagine that your audience is a high school student who is exploring the
benefits and drawbacks of using computers to solve problems. Your video
for this task should be 1-3 minutes. Start with your face and your
student ID visible for a few seconds at the beginning, and introduce
yourself audibly while on screen. You don’t have to be on camera for the
rest of the video, though it’s fine if you are. When you are giving
examples, you should speak about them as well as having them displayed
on the screen (written or typed using clear and correct notation if
relevant, or screen shots from the video if relevant).</p></li>
<li><p>In the document part of this task, you will explore what mistakes
our choice of representations can cause by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pick one of the definitions we’ve used in CSE 20 for representing
<span><strong>numbers</strong></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the definition for this representation into your writeup,
and cite which page of which week’s notes you’re using.</p></li>
<li><p>Describe, using roster method or set builder notation, the set of
numbers that can represented with this number representation
definition.</p></li>
<li><p>Give an example of a limitation of this number representation by
showing what error could be introduced when using this number
representation for an application of your choosing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Type out your work</strong></span> above and upload
your PDF to Gradescope.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>Your work on the project will be assigned a letter grade.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To earn at least a C on the project, most parts of the project
should be attempted and your submission should correctly demonstrate
some of the tools, techniques, and formalisms we used in class.</p></li>
<li><p>To earn at least a B on the project, almost all of the parts of
the project should be substantially complete, and a significant amount
of detail and correct notation should be used throughout your examples
and explanations.</p></li>
<li><p>To earn at least an A on the project, all of the parts of the
project should be substantially complete, with correct and appropriate
use of CSE 20 concepts and notation and clear and detailed
explanations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Since the project is also used to add +/- modifiers at the end of the
quarter, you can consider going beyond the requirements as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For example: in your PDF writeup for task 1, you could propose
several alternate modelling choices and discuss the tradeoffs
(advantages and disadvantages) between them.</p></li>
<li><p>Another exmaple: in your PDF writeup for task 2, you could
discuss what could be done to detect or correct possible errors
resulting from choices of data representations.</p></li>
<li><p>You are welcome to explore other extensions too. Keep in mind,
however, that resource limitations means we will be limited to grading
no more than 4 minutes of video and 2 pages for each task.</p></li>
