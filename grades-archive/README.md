## Installation

Install `pip3`. This might be the easiest way on new-ish Macs:

```
python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

A few options are here:

Then, the project relies on the following packages:

```
pip3 install notebook gspread pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

(gspread is this project: https://github.com/burnash/gspread)

To make sure things play nicely with `git`, next run:

```
git config --local include.path ../.notebook-config
```

This makes it so an extra step runs before each `git` operation that cleans out
the output, so that output metadata isn't part of what gets checked in.

You should then be able to use

```
jupyter notebook
```

from this checkout to start up and open `analysis.ipynb`.


## Files and Student Data

For student privacy, the Gradescope download file

/Users/miaminneskemp/GitHub/discrete-math-for-cs/grades/CSE20_SP24_A00_Spring_2024_grades.csv

and the output file 

/Users/miaminneskemp/GitHub/discrete-math-for-cs/grades/CSE20S24.grades.csv

should be kept local.  The notebook 

/Users/miaminneskemp/GitHub/discrete-math-for-cs/grades/analysis.ipynb

can be committed to the repo.
