\newcommand{\instructions}{{\bf For all HW assignments:} 
These homework assignments may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students.
Please ensure your name(s) and PID(s)
are clearly visible on the first page of your homework
submission, start each question on a new page, and upload the PDF to Gradescope.
If you're working in a group, {\it submit only one submission per group}: one partner uploads the
submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other group member(s) to the Gradescope submission
by selecting their name(s) in the ``Add Group Members'' dialog box. You will need to re-add your group member(s)
every time you resubmit a new version of your assignment.

Each homework question will be graded either for
{\bf correctness} (including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all answers) or
{\bf fair effort completeness}. You may collaborate on ``graded for correctness''
questions only with CSE 20 students in your group; if your
 group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a private
post (visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza.  
 For ``graded for completeness''
 questions: collaboration is allowed with any CSE 20 students this quarter; 
 if your group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in 
 help hours or post a public post on Piazza.

All submitted homework for this class must be typed. 
You can use a word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office, Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) 
but you might find it useful to take this opportunity to learn LaTeX. 
LaTeX is a markup language used widely in computer science and mathematics. 
The homework assignments are typed using LaTeX and you can use the source files 
as templates for typesetting your solutions.

{\bf Integrity reminders}
\begin{itemize}
\item Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the partners. The homework is
designed to give you practice with the main concepts and techniques of the course, 
while getting to know and learn from your classmates.
\item You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for correctness with anyone other than your group members.
You may ask questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs, and/or tutors) and 
on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the Instructors).  
You \emph{cannot} use any online resources about the course content other than the class material 
from this quarter -- this is primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and
definitions (aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience you will have when
the `aha' moments of solving the problem authentically happen.
\item Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework with 
other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so would dilute their learning 
experience and detract from their success in the class.
\end{itemize}

\item[1. Modeling, Sets and Functions, Algorithms] 
In machine learning, clustering can be used to group similar data for prediction and recommendation.  For example,
each Netflix user's viewing history can be represented as a $n$-tuple indicating their preferences about
movies in the database, where $n$ is the number of movies in the database.  Each element in the $n$-tuple indicate
the user's rating of the corresponding movie: 
$1$ indicates the person liked the movie, $-1$
that they didn't, and $0$ that they didn't rate it one way or another.

Consider the following algorithm for determining if a user's viewing history represents
strong opinions on many movies.
\begin{algorithm}[caption={Determine if user's ratings tuple encode strong opinions}]
procedure $\textit{opinion}$($(r_1, \ldots, r_n)$: a $n$-tuple of ratings; $c$: a nonnegative integer)
$sum$ := $0$
for $i$ := $1$ to $n$
  if $r_i \neq 0$
    $sum$ := $sum + 1$
return $sum \geq c$
\end{algorithm}

  \begin{enumerate}\item When $n = 3$, describe the set of all $n$-tuples representing user ratings
  \begin{enumerate}\item By the roster method.
  
  \ifsolution{
  \sol{There are 27 $3$-tuples whose elements are each $-1$, $0$, or $1$.  We can list them as follows.
  \begin{align*}
  \{ & (-1, -1, -1) , (-1, -1, 0) , (-1, -1, 1) , (-1, 0, -1), (-1, 0, 0), (-1, 0, 1),\\
     & (-1, 1, -1), (-1, 1, 0), (-1, 1, 1), (0, -1, -1) , (0, -1, 0) , (0, -1, 1) , \\
     & (0, 0, -1), (0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 1, -1), (0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1), (1, -1, -1) , \\
     & (1, -1, 0) , (1, -1, 1) , (1, 0, -1), (1, 0, 0), (1, 0, 1), (1, 1, -1), (1, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1) \}  
  \end{align*}
  }}\fi
  
  \item With set builder notation.
  
  \ifsolution{
  \sol{Using set builder notation, we can specify the constraints on each component of the $3$-tuple:
\[
	\{ (x,y,z) ~\mid~ x \in \{-1,0,1\}~\text{and}~ y\in \{-1,0,1\}~\text{and}~ z \in \{-1,0,1\} \}
\]  
}}\fi
  
  \item Using a recursive definition.
  
  \ifsolution{
  \sol{  Let's call the set of ratings of three movies $R_3$. We can define this set recursively 
  by listing each of the finitely many tuples in $R_3$ in the basis step and then 
  defining the recursive step to be: when $u \in R_3$, so is $u$.

  Note that this recursive definition is somewhat contrived: the recursive step isn't doing anything helpful.
  }}\fi
  \end{enumerate}
 \item What are the possible return (output) values of this algorithm?
  
  \ifsolution{
  \sol{ Since the algorithm returns the result of a comparison, the possible values are 
  True or False.}
  }\fi
  
  \item {\bf Trace} the computation of $opinion( (-1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1,-1), 2)$.

\ifsolution{\sol{
The computation of $opinion( (-1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1,-1), 2)$  first (in line 2) initializes
the variable $sum$ to $0$ and then steps through each component of the tuple in the for 
loop in line 3, checking (in line 4) if the value is zero or not. The first component
of $(-1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1,-1)$ is nonzero so line 5 increments $sum$, which now has value $1$.
When the for loop checks the components at positions 2,3,4, the $sum$ variable is not updated.
When the for loop 
gets to each of positions 5,6,7, the nonzero value of the elements at these positions means the 
if branch of the condition is followed and the $sum$ variable is incremented three times, to 
get to the value $4$.  In line $6$, the comparison $sum \geq c$ evaluates to $4 \geq 2$, which is True.
Thus, $opinion( (-1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1,-1), 2)$ returns True.
}}\fi

  \item Give an example of a nonnegative integer $c$ so that, no matter which $n$-tuple
  $(r_1, \ldots, r_n)$ we consider, $opinion( (r_1, \ldots, r_n), c)$ will have the same value.
  What value is it?

\ifsolution{\sol{The nonnegative integer $c = 0$ is an example.  The value of $sum$ is initialized to $0$ in line 2. 
The values of the components $n$-tuple $(r_1, \ldots, r_n)$ determine whether the value of $sum$ ever increases in the form loop lines 3-5; the value can never decrease. Thus, no matter the choice of $n$-tuple,
 the comparison $sum \geq 0$ will evaluate to True.
}}\fi


\end{enumerate}

\item[2. Sets and Functions] \qquad \\
\begin{enumerate}\item Give a recursive definition for the set $\mathbb{N}$.

\ifsolution{\sol{The set of nonnegative integers can be defined recursively as follows:

Basis step: $0 \in \mathbb{N}$

Recursive step: If $x \in \mathbb{N}$ then $x+1 \in \mathbb{N}$.
}}\fi

\item Use the recursive definition from part (a) to give a recursive definition for the function with domain $\mathbb{N}$, codomain
$\mathbb{N}$ which computes, for input $i$, the sum of the first $i$ powers of $2$.  For example, on input $0$, the function 
evaluates to $2^0$, namely to $1$.  On input $1$, the function evaluates to $2^0 + 2^1$, namely $3$. 
On input $2$, the function evaluates to $2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2$, namely $7$. 

\ifsolution{\sol{Let's call this function $sumPow$.  Its recursive definition will mirror the recursive definition of its domain, from part (a).

$sumPow: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$

Basis step: $sumPow(0) = 1$.

Recursive step: If $x \in \mathbb{N}$ then $sumPow(x+1) = sumPow(x) + 2^{x+1}$.

In this function definition, we assumed that we have access to a definition of the power function
to compute powers of two. In fact, we can define this
function recursively as well:

$powTwo: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$

Basis step: $powTwo(0) = 1$.

Recursive step: If $x \in \mathbb{N}$ then $powTwo(x+1) = 2 powTwo(x) = powTwo(x) + powTwo(x)$.

}}\fi
\end{enumerate}

\item[3. Base expansions, Multiple representations] \qquad \\
\begin{enumerate}\item Compute the ternary (base 3) expansion of $28$.

\ifsolution
\sol{
We can express $28$ in terms of powers of $3$ as 
\[
28 = 1 \cdot 27 + 1  = 1 \cdot 3^3 + 0 \cdot 3^2 + 0 \cdot 3^1 + 1 \cdot 3^0 = (1001)_3.
\]
Therefore, by definition of base $3$ expansion, $28 = (1001)_3$.
}
\else{}
\fi
\item Compute the product of $(6A)_{16}$ and $(11)_{16}$, without converting
either number to another base.

\ifsolution
\sol{
We use the usual algorithm for multiplication, except using hexadecimal symbols.

\begin{align*}
   &6A \\
\underline{\times~ }&\underline{11} \\
& 6A \\
\underline{+6~}&\underline{A0} \\
7&0A
\end{align*}

Thus, the product of $(6A)_{16}$ and $(11)_{16}$ is $(70A)_{16}$.
}
\else{}
\fi

\item Confirm your answer for part (b) by converting $(6A)_{16}$ and $(11)_{16}$ to
decimal, multiplying them, and converting the product to base $16$.

\ifsolution
\sol{
Converting:
\[
(6A)_{16} = 6  \cdot  16^1 +  10 \cdot 16^0  = 96 +  10 =  106
\]
\[
(11)_{16} = 1 \cdot 16^1 +  1 \cdot 16^0  = 16+  1 =  17
\]
Multiplying in decimal:

\begin{align*}
   &106 \\
\underline{\times~ }&\underline{~17} \\
& 742 \\
\underline{+1}&\underline{060} \\
1&802
\end{align*}

Converting back to hexadecimal:  by long  division, 
\begin{align*}
1802 &= 112\cdot 16  + 10 \\
112  &= 7 \cdot 16 +  0\\
7 &= 0 \cdot 16 + 7
\end{align*}
Thus, $1802  = (70A)_{16}$, agreeing  with part (b).
}

\fi

\item How many bits will there be in the binary (base $2$) expansion of $2020$?  Can you compute this
without fully converting $2020$ to base $2$?


\ifsolution
\sol{
The  leading coefficient will need to be in the column  corresponding to the highest power  of $2$ less
than  or equal to   $2020$. Listing the powers of $2$:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Exponent & $0$ & $1$ & $2$ &  $3$  &  $4$  & $5$ & $6$ & $7$ & $8$ & $9$ &  $10$ & $11$\\
\hline
Power &$1$ & $2$ & $4$ &  $8$  &  $16$  & $32$ & $64$ & $128$ & $256$ & $512$ &  $1024$ & $2048$\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
we see  that the binary expansion of $2020$  will  be of the  form  $(1a_{9} \cdots a_0)_{2}$ and will therefore
have $11$ bits.
}

\item Give an example of a number that can be represented in base 2 fixed-width 3,
but not in base 2 expansion.

$(000)_{2,3}$.

\item Give an example of a number that can be represented in
base 2 expansion, but not in base 2, fixed-width 3 expansion.

\ifsolution
\sol{
The number $8$ can be  represented in base  $2$ as $(1000)_2$ but can't be represented in 
binary fixed-width $3$ because it requires four bits.}
\else{}
\fi

\item Give the representation of -7 in sign-magnitude width 3 and 2s complement
width 3. Then do the same for width 4.

\ifsolution
\sol{
The  number $-7$ can't be represented in sign magnitude width 3 or in 2s complement width 3:
\begin{itemize}
\item The least number that can be represented in sign magnitude width 3 has representation $[111]_{s,3}$ 
and is  $-3$.
\item The least number that can be represented in 2s complement width 3 has representation $[100]_{2c,3}$ 
and is  $-4$.
\end{itemize}
With width 4 we can use the following representations:
\begin{itemize}
\item In sign magnitude width 4, $-7$ has representation $[1111]_{s,4}$  because the leftmost bit  is the 
sign bit and the magnitude  of $-7$ has binary fixed width 3 representation $7 = (111)_{2,3}$.
\item In 2s complement width 4, $-7$ has representation $[1001]_{2c,4}$  because the leftmost bit  is the 
sign bit and rightmost bits need to  represent $2^{4-1}-7 = 1$ in binary fixed width 3, $(001)_{2,3}$.
Alternatively, we calculate that $[1001]_{2c,4} = 1 \cdot (-2)^3 + 0 \cdot 2^2 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^0 = -8 + 1 = -7$.
\end{itemize}
}
\else{}
\fi

\item Give the representation of 10.5625 in fixed-width base-2 expansion with
integer width 4 and fractional width 9.

\ifsolution

We need  to write $10.5625$ as 
\[
(a_3 a_2 a_1 a_0.c_1  c_2 c_3  c_4 c_5  c_6 c_7 c_8 c_9)_{2,4,9}
\]
For the integer part:  $10 = 1\cdot 2^3 +  0 \cdot 2^2 + 1 \cdot 2^1 + 0 \cdot  2^0 = (1010)_2$

For the fractional part: $0.5625 =  1\cdot 2^{-1}  +  0 \cdot  2^{-2} + 0 \cdot 2^{-3} + 1 \cdot 2^{-4} $
where
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Exponent & $-1$ & $-2$ & $-3$ &  $-4$  &  $-5$ & $-6$ & $-7$ \\

\hline
\end{tabular}

Thus, 
\[
10.5625 = (1010.100100000)_{2,4,9}

\item[4. Circuits]   
A triangular number (or triangle number) counts the objects that can form an equilateral
triangle, as in the diagram below. The $n^{\text{th}}$ triangular number is the sum of the first $n$
 integers,
as shown in the following figure illustrating the first four triangular numbers (what is the
fifth one?):
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2.7in]{../../resources/images/triangle.png}
\end{center}
Design a circuit that takes four inputs $x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3$ and outputs
True (T or 1) if the integer value 
$(x_3x_2x_1x_0)_{2,4} $ is a triangular number, and False (F or 0) otherwise. You may assume that 0 is
not a triangular number. ({\it Credit: UBC Department of Computer Science})

\ifsolution{
\sol{
Using the definition, we can write a table of values for the circuit we need to build, since the output will be 
one when $(x_3 x_2 x_1 x_0)_{2,4}$ will be one of $1, 3, 6, 10, 15$.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cccc||c}
$x_3$& $x_2$ & $x_1$ & $x_0$ & Output \\
\hline
$1$ & $1$ & $1$ & $1$ & $1$ \\
$1$ & $1$ & $1$ & $0$ & $0$ \\
$1$ & $1$ & $0$ & $1$ & $0$ \\
$1$ & $1$ & $0$ & $0$ & $0$ \\
$1$ & $0$ & $1$ & $1$ & $0$ \\
$1$ & $0$ & $1$ & $0$ & $1$ \\
$1$ & $0$ & $0$ & $1$ & $0$ \\

$0$ & $1$ & $1$ & $1$ & $0$ \\
$0$ & $1$ & $1$ & $0$ & $1$ \\
$0$ & $1$ & $0$ & $1$ & $0$ \\

$0$ & $0$ & $0$ & $1$ & $1$ \\
$0$ & $0$ & $0$ & $0$ & $0$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The output can be described using a compound proposition in DNF with five clauses (because there 
are five rows with output $1$): 
\begin{align*}
&(x_3 \land x_2 \land x_1 \land x_0) \vee (x_3 \land \neg x_2 \land x_1 \land \neg x_0) \vee
(\neg x_3 \land x_2 \land x_1 \land \neg x_0) \\
&\vee (\neg x_3 \land \neg x_2 \land x_1 \land x_0) \vee
(\neg x_3 \land \neg x_2 \land \neg x_1 \land x_0)
\end{align*}
We can use this DNF to draw a circuit that takes the four inputs and whose output is described.

Alternatively, a  logically equivalent compound proposition is
\[
output = \left [ x_1 \wedge ( x_0 \oplus x_2) \oplus x_3 \right] \vee \left [ \neg x_3 \wedge \neg x_2 \wedge \neg x_1 \wedge x_0 \right]
\]

Using this compound proposition, we can draw a circuit with fewer gates than the one described above.

Note: we didn't include picture of circuits in these sample solutions; 
please come to office hours or post to Piazza if you'd like to get feedback 
on a circuit you draw.

Since XOR gates are available, we can use a convenient relationship between XOR and $\leftrightarrow$:

$\land$ and $\to$:
\[
(p \oplus q) \leftrightarrow r \equiv (~ (p \oplus q) \to r~) \land (~r \to (p \oplus q)~)

Now, we replace $\to$ by its equivalent disjunctive form: $HYP \to CONC \equiv (\neg HYP) \vee CONC$.
Thus, 
\[
(~ (p \oplus q) \to r~) \land (~r \to (p \oplus q)~) \equiv (~ \neg (p \oplus q) \vee r~) \land (~\neg r \vee (p \oplus q)~)

Last, we replace the XOR with equivalent compound propositions in terms of the other connectives:
the XOR is true means one of its inputs is T and the other F; the XOR is false means its inputs are both T or both F.

The given compound proposition is in CNF and indicates that the rows in the truth table 
with $p=F, q=F, r = T$, $p=F, q= T, r= F$, and $p =T, q=F, r=F$ are set to F.  Thus, the truth table is 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc||c}

\ifsolution
\sol{
Yes, these statements are consistent.  Consider the assignment of truth values
\[
p = T \qquad q = T \qquad r = T \qquad s = T \qquad u = F
\]
We evaluate the four compound propositions at this assignment to confirm that it makes 
all of them true simulatneously:
\begin{align*}
p \to (r \vee s \vee u) & = T \to (T \vee T \vee F) = T \to T = T \\
q \to (s \vee u) &= T \to (T \vee F) = T \to T = T \\ 
p \leftrightarrow q &= T \leftrightarrow T = T \\
\neg u & = \neg F = T

Translating to English, we get ``The display is 13.3-inch, the processor is 2.2GHz, 
there is at least 
128GB of flash storage, there is at least 256GB of flash storage, but there is not at

Determine whether each of the compound propositions below is equivalent to the {\bf negation} of that statement, and justify your answers using either truth tables or other equivalences.

Possible compound propositions:
\begin{itemize}

The sentence can be translated to $\neg ( p \wedge q)$.  Its negation is then
\[
\neg \neg (p \wedge q) ~\equiv~  ( p \wedge q)

\]
because $A \wedge \neg B \equiv \neg (A \to B)$
so $p \wedge q \equiv \neg (A \to \neg B)$.

This is also equivalent to  $(\neg p \leftrightarrow \neg q) \wedge p$, as we can see from
the last two columns of the the truth

The contrapositive of this conditional

nor $\forall x Q(x)$ is True, because each predicate  at least one  domain element where it evaluates
to  False (for counterexamples: $P(2)$ is  False and $Q(1)$  is False).  Since $F \vee  F = F$, 
$(\forall x P(x)) \vee (\forall x Q(x))$ is False. Since there is  some definition of the predicates $P$ and
$Q$ where the two  statements  
\[

 \forall x  (~ P(x) \vee Q(x) ~)

We  now prove  that each  of the statements is True:
\begin{itemize}
\item To prove  the universal  statement $\forall x (P(x) \to Q(x))$, we  evaluate  the conditional  
at each element in the domain: At  $0$,  $P(0)  \to Q(0) = T \to T = T$;  at $1$,  $P(1) \to Q(1) = F \to T =  T$; 
at $2$,  $P(2) \to Q(2) = F \to F =  T$.   Since the body of the quantification is True at  all element 
in the domain,  $\forall x  (P (x) \to Q(x))$ is True.
\item  To prove the  existential  statement $\exists x P(x)$, we need a witness  in  the  domain where
$P(x)$  evaluates to  True.  The witness is $0$, since the first row in the definition table gives $P(0) = T$.
\item  To prove the  existential  statement $\exists x \neg P(x)$, we need a witness  in  the  domain where
$\neg P(x)$  evaluates to  True.  The witness is $1$, since the second row in the definition table gives $P(1) = F$ so $\neg P(1) = T$.
\item  To prove the  existential  statement $\exists x \neg Q(x)$, we need a witness  in  the  domain where
$\neg Q(x)$  evaluates to  True.  The witness is $2$, since the third row in the definition table gives $Q(2) = F$ so $\neg Q(2) = T$.

\begin{itemize}
\item[]Basis step: $F_{\A}(\A) = T$, $F_{\A}(\C) = F_{\A}(\G) = F_{\A}(\U) = F$
\item[]Recursive step: If $s \in S$ and $b \in B$, then $F_{\A}(sb) = F_{\A}(s)$
\end{itemize}

$P_{\A\U\C}$ with domain $S$ is defined as the predicate whose truth set
is the collection of RNA strands where the string $\A\U\C$
is a substring (appears inside $s$, in order and consecutively)

$L$ with domain $S \times \mathbb{Z}^+$ is defined by, for $s \in S$ and $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$,

A witness  is  $s_1 = \C\C\C\C$, $s_2 = \G\G\G\G$.  Since  each of  $s_1, s_2$ is  an element of $S$, 
$s_1$ has  length $4$, $s_2$ has length $4$ and these two strings are not the same.
