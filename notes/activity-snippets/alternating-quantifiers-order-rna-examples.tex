{\bf Alternating nested quantifiers}



$$\forall s \in S ~\exists n \in \mathbb{N} ~(~basecount(~(s,\U)~) = n~)$$

In English: For each strand, there is a nonnnegative integer that counts the number of occurrences of $\U$ in that 
strand.\\

$$\exists n \in \mathbb{N} ~\forall s \in S ~(~basecount(~(s,\U)~) = n~)$$

In English: There is a nonnnegative integer that counts the number of occurrences of $\U$ in every 
strand.\\

Are these statements true or false?

\newpage

$$\forall s \in S ~\exists b\in B ~(~basecount(~(s,b)~) = 3~)$$

In English: For each RNA strand there is a base that occurs 3 times in this strand.\\

Write the negation and use De Morgan's law to find a 
logically equivalent version where the negation is applied only to the 
$BC$ predicate (not next to a quantifier).

Is the original statement {\bf True} or {\bf False}?
