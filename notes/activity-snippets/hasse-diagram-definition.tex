For a partial ordering, its {\bf Hasse diagram} is a graph representing the 
relationship between elements in the ordering. The nodes (vertices) of the graph 
are the elements of the 
domain of the binary relation. The edges do not have arrow heads. The
directionality of the partial order is indicated by 
the arrangements of the notes. The nodes are arranged so that nodes connected to nodes
above them by edges indicate that the relation holds between the 
lower node and the higher node. 
Moreover, the diagram omits self-loops and 
omits edges that are guaranteed by transitivity.
