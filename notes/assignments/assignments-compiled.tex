    \item Modeling
    \begin{enumerate}[labelindent=0pt, leftmargin=0pt]
        \item\gradeCompleteFirst In class, we used $4$-tuples to represent the user ratings for four movies. 
        This representation is memory-efficient because we use the order of the components in the $4$-tuples to 
        represent which move is being rated. However, it is not easily extended when we want to add new movies to the database.
        Define a new model that would allow us to represent the user ratings of movie databases where we allow for new movies to be added.
        Use only the data types we have talked about in class: sets, $n$-tuples, and strings. Explain the design choices
        that you used to define your model by referencing properties of the data-type(s) you choose.
        Demonstrate your model by showing how the rating of the user who dislikes Dune and Oppenheimer and likes Barbie and Nimona
        is represented.

        Colors can be described as amounts of red, green, and blue mixed together
        \footnote{This RGB representation is common in web applications.  Many online tools are available to play around with mixing these colors,  e.g. \url{https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp}. }
        Mathematically, a color can be represented as a $3$-tuple $(r, g, b)$ where $r$ represents the red component, $g$ the green component, $b$ the blue component and where each of $r$, $g$, $b$ must be a value from this collection of numbers:

        Can you find two different $3$-tuples that represent colors that are indistinguishable to your eye? You can use the website in the footnote to play around
        with different choices of red, green, and blue levels to see if you can distinguish between the resulting colors.
        Why or why not? 

        A complete answer will include the specific example $3$-tuples that work, along with a description of the colors that they represent and why they
        are indistinguishable, or an explanation of why there can't be such an example.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Sets and functions
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \gradeCorrectFirst Each of the sets below is described 
using set builder notation or recursion or as a result of set operations
applied to other known sets.  Rewrite each of the sets using the roster method.

Remember our discussions of data-types: use clear notation that 
is consistent with our class notes and definitions 
to communicate the data-types of the elements in each set.


\rule{0.5\textwidth}{.4pt}

{\it Sample response that can be used as reference for the detail expected 
in your answer:} 

The set $\{ \A \} \circ \{ \A\U, \A\C, \A\G\}$ can be written using
the roster method as 
\[
\{ \A\A\U, \A\A\C, \A\A\G \}
\]
because set-wise concatenation gives a set whose elements are 
all possible results of concatenating an element of the 
left set with an 
element of the right set. Since the left set in this example only
has one element, namely $\A$, each of the elements of the set we 
described starts with $\A$. There are three elements of this set, 
one for each of the distinct elements of the right set.

\rule{0.5\textwidth}{.4pt}

\begin{enumerate}
\item $$\{ n \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \mid n \leq 3 \} \times \{ m \in \mathbb{N} \mid m \leq 3\}$$ (Note: typo fixed Apr 3)
\item The set $X$ defined recursively as 
    \[
    \begin{array}{ll}
    \textrm{Basis Step: } & 1 \in X, 3 \in X, 5 \in X \\
    \textrm{Recursive Step: } & \textrm{If the integer } n \in X \textrm{, then the result of multiplying } n \textrm{ by } -1 \textrm{ is in }X
    \end{array}
    \]
\item $$\{ x \in S \mid rnalen(x) = 2 \} \circ \{x \in S \mid rnalen(x) = 0 \}$$
where $S$ is the set of RNA strands and $rnalen$ is the recursively defined
function that we discussed in class,
\[
\begin{array}{llll}
& & \textit{rnalen} : S & \to \mathbb{Z}^+ \\
\textrm{Basis Step:} & \textrm{If } b \in B\textrm{ then } & \textit{rnalen}(b) & = 1 \\
\textrm{Recursive Step:} & \textrm{If } s \in S\textrm{ and }b \in B\textrm{, then  } & \textit{rnalen}(sb) & = 1 + \textit{rnalen}(s)
\end{array}
\]
\item $$\{ (r,g,b) \in C \mid r+g+b = 2 \textrm{ and } g=1\}$$ where 
$C = \{ (r,g,b) \mid 0 \leq r \leq 255, 0 \leq g \leq 255, 0 \leq b \leq 255, r \in \mathbb{N}, g \in \mathbb{N}, b \in \mathbb{N} \}$
is the set that you worked with in Monday's review quiz.
\end{enumerate}

\item\gradeCorrect Recall the function which takes an ordered pair of ratings $4$-tuples and returns a measure of the difference between them
\[
    d_0: \{-1,0,1\}^4 \times \{-1,0,1\}^4 \to \mathbb{R}
\]
given by
\[
d_0 (~(~ (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4), (y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4) ~) ~) = \sqrt{ (x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2 + (x_3 -y_3)^2 + (x_4 -y_4)^2}
\]

Define a {\bf new} function which we'll call $d_{new}$ with the same domain $\{-1,0,1\}^4 \times \{-1,0,1\}^4$
and codomain $\mathbb{R}$ but where there is some example pair of ratings $4$-tuples 
\[(~ (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4), (y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4)~)\]
where
\[
d_0 (~(~ (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4), (y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4) ~) ~) \neq d_{new} (~(~ (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4), (y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4) ~) ~)
\]

    Your answer should include  {\bf both} a precise and clear definition for the rule defining
    $d_{new}$ which unambiguously specifies output for each input of the function {\bf and}
    the example ordered pair of ratings $4$-tuples that demonstrate that the functions are not equal.
    Also include a justification 
    of your answers with (clear, correct, complete) calculations for each of the function applications 
    and/or references to definitions and connecting them with
    the desired conclusion.

\item\gradeCorrect A function \textit{basecount} that computes the number of a given base 
$b$ appearing in a RNA strand $s$ is defined recursively:
    
\[
\begin{array}{llll}
& \textit{basecount} : S \times B & \to \mathbb{N} &\\
\textrm{Basis Step:} &  \\
\textrm{If } b_1 \in B, b_2 \in B & \textit{basecount}(~(b_1, b_2)~) & = 
        \begin{cases}
            1 & \textrm{when } b_1 = b_2 \\
            0 & \textrm{when } b_1 \neq b_2 \\
        \end{cases}& \\
\textrm{Recursive Step:} & \\
\textrm{If } s \in S, b_1 \in B, b_2 \in B &\textit{basecount}(~(s b_1, b_2)~) & =
        \begin{cases}
            1 + \textit{basecount}(~(s, b_2)~) & \textrm{when } b_1 = b_2 \\
            \textit{basecount}(~(s, b_2)~) & \textrm{when } b_1 \neq b_2 \\
        \end{cases} &
\end{array}
\]
Consider the function application 
\[
  basecount( ~(\A\C\A\U, \A)~)
\]
What is the input?  What is the output? Give an example of a different choice of input that 
gives the same output.

Your answer should include clearly labeled answers to each of the three parts of the question, 
along with a justification for the values of the applications that makes specific reference to 
the parts of the recursive definition of the $basecount$ function used to calculate it.

{\bf Assigned questions}

\begin{enumerate}[labelindent=0pt, leftmargin=0pt]
\item Functions and algorithms: in this question you'll explore the properties of the (integer) power and logarithm
functions. We'll use some definitions we introduced in class this week, namely the function
$b^i$ with domain $\mathbb{Z}^+ \times \mathbb{N}$ and codomain $\mathbb{N}$ defined recursively by
\begin{align*}    
&\textrm{Basis Step:} \\
&b^0 = 1 \\
&\textrm{Recursive Step:}\\
&\textrm{If } i \in \mathbb{N}, b^{i+1} = b \cdot b^i
\end{align*}
and the algorithm:
\input{../activity-snippets/algorithm-log.tex}


    \begin{enumerate}
    \item\gradeCorrectFirst Choose a positive integer $b$ between $3$ and $6$ (inclusive) and choose a 
    nonnegative integer $i$ between $2$ and $5$ (inclusive). Demonstrate how to calculate 
    the result of the $logb$ algorithm (procedure) when its input is the base $b$ you chose and
    $n = b^i$ (for the $i$ you choose.) 
    A complete answer will include the specific choice of $b$ and $i$, along with 
    trace of the calculations of $b^i$ and the computation of the algorithm, including 
    (clear, correct, complete) calculations for each of the function applications 
    and/or references to definitions and a trace table for algorithm that includes the values of all relevant 
    variables at each iteration (See the annotated Week 2 notes for the level of detail expected
    in a trace of a function application and a trace table).
    \item\gradeCorrect Now we'll go in other order: Demonstrate how to calculate the result of 
    $7^y$ where $y$ is the result of the $logb$ algorithm (procedure) when its input is $b=7$ and $n=30$.
    A complete answer will include clearly labelled 
    traces of the calculations of $b^i$ and the computation of the algorithm, including 
    (clear, correct, complete) calculations for each of the function applications 
    and/or references to definitions and a trace table for algorithm that includes the values of all relevant 
    variables at each iteration (See the annotated Week 2 notes for the level of detail expected
    in a trace of a function application and a trace table).    
    \item\gradeCompleteFirst Logarithms and powers are supposed to ``undo" one another. Explain whether your work in parts (a) and (b)
    supports that idea,  whether you saw anything confusing or surprising about these calculations, and how to explain what you saw.
    \end{enumerate}

\item Base expansions
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item\gradeComplete Pick an integer between $50$ and $1000$ (inclusive) that you (or one of your
        group members) came across at some point this week. 
        In a sentence or two, give some context for why you're choosing this number). 
        Write the base expansion of your chosen number in base $2$ (binary), base $3$ (ternary), base $4$, and base $16$ (hexadecimal).
        \item\gradeCorrect What is the {\bf smallest} width $w$ in which they could write your chosen number in base $8$ (octal) 
        fixed-width $w$? Justify your answer with reference to the definitions of fixed-width expansions and relevant calculations.
        \item\gradeCorrect Express in roster method the set of numbers between $1$ and $2$ (exclusive) that be written without error 
        (full precision)
        in binary fixed width expansion with integer part width $3$ and fractional part width $2$. Justify your answer with 
        reference to the definitions of fixed-width expansions and relevant calculations.
        \item\gradeCorrect Consider the strings of $1$s that have length $3$, $5$, $7$, and $10$.
        Calculate the numbers 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[] $[111]_{s,3}$
            \item[] $[11111]_{s,5}$
            \item[] $[1111111]_{s,7}$
            \item[] $[1111111111]_{s,10}$
            \item[] $[111]_{2c,3}$
            \item[] $[11111]_{2c,5}$
            \item[] $[1111111]_{2c,7}$
            \item[] $[1111111111]_{2c,10}$
        \end{itemize}
        Justify your answers with specific reference to the definitions of sign-magnitude and $2$s complement expansions and relevant calculations.
        \item \gradeComplete What patterns do you notice in your calculations in part (d)?
    \end{enumerate}

\item Multiple representations

Recall that, mathematically, a color can be represented as a $3$-tuple $(r, g, b)$ 
where $r$ represents the red component, $g$ the green component, $b$ the blue component and where each of $r$, $g$, $b$ must be from the collection $\{x \in \mathbb{N}\mid 0 \leq x \leq 255 \}$.
As an alternative representation, in this assignment
we'll use base $b$ fixed-width expansions to represent colors
as individual numbers (this definition was introduced in this week's Review quiz).

\input{../activity-snippets/quiz-color-hexcolor-definition.tex}

For this question, let's call the set of hex colors $H$. In the Week 2 Review quiz (Question 3d), 
we explored a few different set builder definitions for $H$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \gradeComplete Rewrite the set builder definition of a set below so that it 
refers to colors rather than numbers: $\{ c \in H \mid c \mod 256 = 0\}$. A complete answer will 
justify the new set builder definition by connection with the definition of hex colors and how it impacts
the colors that satisfy the specific property for this set.
\item \gradeCorrect Rewrite the set builder definition of a set below so that it 
refers to colors rather than numbers: $\{ c \in H \mid c < 65536\}$. A complete answer will 
justify the new set builder definition by connection with the definition of hex colors and how it impacts
the colors that satisfy the specific property for this set.
\item \gradeCorrect In art, we can mix two colors to get a new color. For example, red and blue make 
purple, blue and yellow make green, red and yellow make orange. 
A mathematical definition of {\bf hex color mixing} would be a function with domain $H \times H$
and codomain $H$ where the result of applying this function to an input $(n_1, n_2)$ is the hex color
that results from mixing the hex colors $n_1$ and $n_2$.


\rule{0.5\textwidth}{.4pt}

{\it Sample work for a related question that can be used as reference for the detail expected 
in your answer:} Consider the attempted mathematical definition  $f_1: H\times H \to H$ given by
\[
f_1 (~(n_1, n_2) ~) = n_1 + n_2
\]
We will show that this function is not well-defined so it cannot give a hex color mixing definition. 
The reason it is not well-defined
is that the application of the rule sometimes gives values that are not in the stated codomain. 
To see this, we need an example input to $f_1$ for which the output of the rule is not in $H$.
Here is one such example: $(n_1, n_2) = (~(FFFFFF)_{16,6}, (FFFFFF)_{16,6}~)$. 
This example is in $H \times H$
because $(FFFFFF)_{16,6}$ is a nonnegative integer that has a base $16$ fixed-width $6$ expansion 
so it is a hex color.
We now apply the definition of the rule in $f_1$:
\begin{align*}
f_1 (~(n_1, n_2) ~) &=  f_1 ( (~(FFFFFF)_{16,6}, (FFFFFF)_{16,6}~) ) = (FFFFFF)_{16,6} + (FFFFFF)_{16,6} \\
&= 2 \left( 15\cdot 16^5 + 15\cdot 16^4 + 15 \cdot 16^3 + 15 \cdot 16^2 + 15 \cdot 16^1 + 15 \cdot 16^0 \right) \\
&= 2 \cdot 15 \cdot (1048576 + 65536 + 4096 + 256 + 16 + 1) = 2 \cdot 15 \cdot 1118481 = 33554430
\end{align*}
This is not a hex color because it is greater than or equal to $16^6 = 16777216$, 
so (using the Week 2 notes on which numbers can be represented
with fixed-width expansions) it does not have a hexadecimal {\bf fixed width $6$} expansion.

\rule{0.5\textwidth}{.4pt}

In this question, we'll look at another attempted mathematical definition for hex color mixing. 
We define $f_2: H\times H \to H$ given by
\[
f_2 (~(n_1, n_2) ~) = (n_1 + n_2) \textbf{ div } 2
\]

This is a well-defined function. You do not need to prove this or hand it in, but it's good practice to make 
sure you understand why it's well-defined. Notice that the function application 
\[
f_2 ( ~(~ (FF0000)_{16,6} , (FFFE00)_{16,6} ~)~)
\]
can be calculated as:
\begin{align*}
f_2&(((FF0000)_{16,6}, (FFFE00)_{16,6}))=
 ((FF0000)_{16,6} + (FFFE00)_{16,6})) \textbf{ div } 2\\
&= \big(~ \left(15\cdot16^5 + 15\cdot16^4 + 0\cdot16^3 + 0\cdot16^2 + 0\cdot16^1 + 0\cdot16^0 \right) \\
&~~~~+~
    \left((15\cdot16^5 + 15\cdot16^4 + 15\cdot16^3 + 14\cdot16^2 + 0\cdot16^1 + 0\cdot16^0\right )~\big )\textbf{ div } 2\\
&= (16711680 + 16776704) \textbf{ div } 2 = 33488384 \textbf{ div } 2 = 16744192
\end{align*}
Since this is less than $16^6 = 16777216$, we can represent it using base $16$ fixed-width $6$:.
$$(16744192)_{10} = 15\cdot16^5 + 15\cdot16^4 + 7\cdot16^3 + 15\cdot16^2 + 0\cdot16^1 + 0\cdot16^0 = (FF7F00)_{16,6}$$

Using the web tool \url{https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp}, we can verify that $(FF0000)_{16,6}$ is red, 
$(FFFE00)_{16,6}$ is yellow, and $(FF7F00)_{16,6}$ is orange.

Show that $f_2$ does not work as a hex color mixing definition by finding
another ordered pair of hex colors for which the result of applying $f_2$ does not give the expected hex color.
Include the numerical description of each colors you mention, alongside a description of them in English. 
Describe how you know what these colors are
(if you use a web color tool, include its URL in your submission writeup; if not, describe your reasoning).
Justify your 
example with (clear, correct, complete) calculations and/or references to definitions, and connecting them with
the desired conclusion.
